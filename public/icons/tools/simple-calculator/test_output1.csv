SSL certificatesThere is a flaw in the SSL security model up until now: what if a bad actor tries to intercept Alice and Bob’s connection and impersonate Bob?
Each time your device connects to a website using SSL (indicated by a web address that starts “https://”), the site sends its SSL certificate, including its public key.
SSL todaySSL hasn’t seen an update since SSL 3.0 in 1996.
Given the popularity of SSL, many web users still refer to web traffic encryption as SSL or SSL/TLS .","Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an internet security protocol, establishing encrypted connections between computers on a network, such as the internet.

For example, logging into your online banking without the encrypted connections provided by SSL means anyone monitoring your connection could see your passwords and other sensitive financial data.

Alice, Bob, and Eve

Computer security specialists often refer to two parties trying to securely exchange information like this as ‘Alice’ and ‘Bob’. There is also ‘Eve’ who is intent on eavesdropping on their connection.

If Alice wants to communicate with Bob securely, they need to encrypt their data. But what is encryption? In the early days of the internet, all encryption was symmetric - the key used to encrypt data was the same key used to decode it.

In order to encrypt data safely and exchange messages, Alice and Bob needed to agree on a shared key. This was usually done via Data Encryption Standard (DES).

DES keys were relatively weak (56 bits), and vulnerable to brute-force attacks by powerful computers trying every possible password combination until it hit on the right one. There also was the problem of key distribution. Once your data is encrypted, how do you send the symmetric key to decode it to someone who might be on the other side of the world?

SSL: Public and private keys

SSL, developed by Netscape in 1995, was designed to solve Alice and Bob’s problem.

As it’s core, SSL (now known as Transport Layer Security or TLS ) uses asymmetric encryption, or Public Key Cryptography. The (Public) key used to encrypt data is not the same as the secret (Private) key used to decrypt it.

The keys are related in a mathematical sense being based on factoring extremely large prime numbers. It’s not important to understand this in-depth except to say that knowing someone’s public key only allows you to encrypt data for them to decode: it cannot be used the other way round.

How SSL works

So, how does SSL work? The answer lies in a combination of traditional symmetric encryption and public key cryptography.

When Alice wants to securely communicate with Bob without Eve listening in, they first perform a virtual handshake. Traditionally, this allowed them to establish specific SSL protocols and encryption algorithms were supported.

Alice’s device uses Bob’s public key to generate a shared secret symmetric encryption key for this particular connection. Bob’s device then uses Alice’s public key to securely confirm that this is the key to use. Having established a common symmetric encryption key, communications are now secure

Using both public key and regular symmetric encryption may sound overelaborate but it has a big advantage. Symmetric encryption is much faster than asymmetric, so it makes much more sense to use public keys as little as necessary.

This set-up is a nightmare for bad actors like Eve. She may well be able to monitor the data passing between Alice and Bob’s devices, but unable to make sense of it. Knowing public keys isn’t helpful for decrypting the data and once the data is encrypted by a symmetric key, it’s equally meaningless.

SSL certificates

There is a flaw in the SSL security model up until now: what if a bad actor tries to intercept Alice and Bob’s connection and impersonate Bob? In that case they could supply their own Public Key to Alice to read all her sensitive personal data.

This is where SSL Certificate authorities come in. Certificate Authorities (CA) are publicly trusted, issuing digital SSL certificates and public keys to people or websites. They also use their own private key to digitally sign these certificates, so others can check it’s valid.

Almost all modern browsers come preloaded with details of trusted certificate authorities and their public keys, so it’s easy to check that the SSL certificate for a particular site is valid. To find out if a website is secured by SSL, you can check for a padlock icon on the address bar - give it a click for more information.

Each time your device connects to a website using SSL (indicated by a web address that starts “https://”), the site sends its SSL certificate, including its public key. Your web browser then validates the certificate, and alerts you if the site appears to lack security.

In practice there are several types of different certificates, but back in the original days of SSL, a certificate was simply used to establish that this is the valid public key for that particular domain.

SSL today

SSL hasn’t seen an update since SSL 3.0 in 1996. Today, the more secure TLS is its successor, becoming the most widely used protocol for securing website traffic.

Given the popularity of SSL, many web users still refer to web traffic encryption as SSL or SSL/TLS . Although Certificate Authorities only offer TLS certificates, they’re still commonly referred to as SSL certificates.

While no form of security is entirely perfect, using SSL/TLS hugely reduces the risk of data traffic between your device and websites being abused by bad actors. The trick to avoiding any SSL issues is making sure your set-up is correct.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssfPB7HzRf4MiinSPinr39-1200-80.png,"{'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WkRqZxYHiTb87wpoZgbQr8-320-80.png', 'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/label_options/acfqv7fymeqqeokh-16232440178307-100-80.png', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssfPB7HzRf4MiinSPinr39-1200-80.png', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/label_options/iowr4zxupv6o427p-16133951599527-100-80.png', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/networks/pq1iobb1aqq0wvit-15512616529749-100-80.png', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/label_options/ucwvz6us56tbiped-16197033537186-100-80.png', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/label_options/8mr9qvopohg1emq1-16122004909425-100-80.png'}"

Both Apple and Google introduced passkey support for their respective mobile systems in 2022, but these can only be stored within their own proprietary password managers.

Passkeys vs Passwords

Passkeys look set to replace passwords, and are considered much safer and easier to use. They work via two sets of encryption keys - one public and one private. The public key is stored in the cloud of the service in question, and the private is only stored on your device. No one will ever know this latter key, and remains encrypted when both keys are combined to unlock access to your account.

There is no need to remember these keys as are they automatically generated by your device and are unique for every account. All you need to create them and authorize their use is your biometric data, such as your fingerprint.

As Dashlane puts it, ""Passkeys are phishing-resistant credentials based on FIDO standards and are the future of online authentication, designed as a more secure and user-friendly replacement for passwords.""



FIDO(opens in new tab) is the alliance that sets the standards for passwordless technologies, and passkeys need to comply with its WebAuthn specifications. It has the backing of all the big tech players - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and so on.

Other popular apps that currently support passkeys include 1Password, another popular password manager, eBay, PayPal and Best Buy. It is expected that eventually, every major app will make the switch to going passwordless.

Blooming is reduced, and there's extra sharpness. But while the brightness beats mid-range OLED TVs easily, cinephiles probably won't make the jump to Sony's TV yet.

Sony's range of 2023 TVs includes the Sony X95L mini-LED model, as well as a lower-end Sony X93L mini-LED model in some countries, including the US (but not the UK). Sony hasn't confirmed pricing or release date yet, but these sets will sit below the flagship Sony A95L QD-OLED TV and above the more mid-range Sony X90L full-array LED TV, and should launch during the first half of 2023 to challenge the best TVs in the world.

I had the chance to see the Sony X95L in action with test footage and movie scenes, in a direct comparison with last-year's Sony X95K equivalent model, and the LG C2 OLED TV, along with a Sony reference monitor (the kind used in actual film production for being near 'perfect' pictures), all showing the same images.

The good news is that the Sony X95L is a great upgrade on last year's model, adding extra brightness that makes the whole picture pop, way more detail in dark scenes, and with a little extra sharpness and smoothness in motion, based on my time with it.

That will be partly thanks to the latest-gen XR image processor, which includes a new XR Clear Image algorithm that now analyzes the exact bitrate, resolution and source of video when upscaling it, so it's less of a one-size-fits-all approach to improving low-res video.

The latest XR Backlight Master Drive algorithm comes from the processor, so it can drive a higher number of dimming zones in the backlight. As a result, the X95L is capable of better dynamic range when light and dark areas are next to each other, and less blooming (where the light bleeds from bright areas into dark areas, causing black tones to look gray).

I was viewing all of the TVs in their 'Vivid' mode, or equivalent (with the exception of the Sony reference monitor, obviously), and yet the X95L also impressed me with how much closer it was to the color tone of the reference monitor than the previous model was – I assume that will be even better when viewed in a more movie-friendly mode, but we'll have to wait for our full review to judge that.

(Image credit: Future)

The new Sony X95L is an improvement in almost every way compared to last year's version, then, but the comparison with the LG C2 OLED is more complicated. As anyone who knows anything about mini-LED and this kind of mid-range OLED screen would expect, the maximum brightness of the Sony was way, way beyond what the LG C2 is capable of.

In individual scene highlights, this is clear; in sports or other bright settings with lots of colors, the difference is actually even clearer – the average brightness (not just in HDR highlights) is so much higher in the mini-LED TV. At a cursory glance, all this extra pop can easily make it seem the more appealing TV.

And it seems to have other advantages too – Sony's motion processing appears to be superior, and in the scenes we saw there was less color banding in big blocks of color, such as skies. This means, in the case of the examples we saw, you get a more realistic and natural graduation of colors in the huge (but subtly different) range of blue tones that make up any shot of the sky.

Again, this might vary depending on the mode, so we'll reserve full judgment until we can test it ourselves.

(Image credit: Future)

However, it was also clear that despite the big improvement in detail in dark areas, it loses out to OLED in that area. More texture was visible in the darkest areas on the C2, for example, and the dark areas appeared elevated (meaning more gray than near-black) in the hardest scenes.

And, of course, even though the X95L improves on the blooming from its mini-LED backlight compared to the older model, the contrast is still nowhere near as precise as OLED's self-lighting pixels deliver.

Also, although the punchier brightness is an advantage in many cases (especially if you watch in a bright room), and has an obvious appeal when put side-by-side with OLED, the LG C2's image overall looked closer to what I was also seeing on the Sony reference monitor.

I was watching in a dark room – the optimum way to view an OLED TV – so the C2 was really in its element. In a brighter room, the C2 may have been more washed-out among reflections, with the Sony A95L more able to push the picture through that. That's the advantage of bright mini-LED TVs.

When it comes to sound, Sony is using a new Acoustic Multi Audio+ system here, which is a bit different to the Acoustic Surface Audio+ used in the Sony A95L. Rather than turning the screen into a speaker, this attaches tweeter drivers to the frame of TV high up on the left and right, combined with other speakers further down. The idea is to steer the sound to add positional audio, though I wasn't able to test this.

As is usual with higher-end Sony TVs, there's HDMI 2.1 support (on two of the four HDMI ports) for 4K 120Hz gaming with VRR. This TV is also 'Perfect for PlayStation 5', which means it supports the PS5's Auto HDR Tone Mapping (which means the PS5 adjusts the HDR of its pictures so it's optimal for your exact screen), and the auto-switching of gaming modes depending on the genre of game you're playing.

Sony's new gaming hub menu is also supported, which makes it easy to adjust specific gaming options, including raising black tones so you can see in the dark more easily, and even making the picture smaller within the screen, so that you can make it more 'glanceable' for some competitive games where that's an advantage.

It's hard to say where the Sony X95L is likely to fall in the scheme of the best 4K TVs without knowing its price, and without being able to test it in greater depth and under our own control; but if it can undercut the price of similar Sony QN95C, then it's shaping up to be a great choice for those who watch in a brighter room.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dn75BwFbcwNL3PGMWuGxhX-1200-80.jpg,"{'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dn75BwFbcwNL3PGMWuGxhX-480-80.jpg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dn75BwFbcwNL3PGMWuGxhX-1200-80.jpg', 'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg'}"

While the technology is already in place, many SSDs, especially in lower-end models, continue to use the older PCIe 3.0 connection in an effort to keep consumer costs down, which indicates that upcoming PCIe 5.0 SSDs will be reserved for customers with some serious money.

PCIe 5.0 SSD

The first model that complies with the new standard looks to be the Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000.

According to Gigabyte’s website , it’s available in 1TB and 2TB formats capable of 9,500 MB/s and 10,000 MB/s sequential read speeds, and 8,500 MB/s and 9,500 MB/s sequential write speeds, respectively, making the 2TB the highest performer of the two. This makes it 37% faster than a typical PCIe 4.0 SSD.

To achieve these impressive figures, the SSDs will be subject to a massive heatsink - heat poses the risk of data loss and even Gigabyte admits this on its product page.

The Aorus Gen5 10000 is available with an optional passive thermal guard with a special nanocarbon coating, but this will be both costly and bulky, which could present compatibility issues even if a motherboard can support the physical PCIe 5.0 connection.

On that cost, it looks to be sold out online, though Tom’s Hardware spotted the 2TB version for sale on Amazon for $679.89.

Garmin Forerunner 265: Two minute review

The Garmin Forerunner 265 and smaller 265S, alongside its sibling the Garmin Forerunner 965, are the latest iterations (at the time of writing) of Garmin’s flagship Forerunner series. The 265 comes less than a year after the release of the critically-acclaimed 255 series, sporting a few updated features, a redesigned watch case, and an all-new AMOLED screen.

Given that the watch is essentially last year's world-class Forerunner inside, I wasn’t sure whether the 265 would do enough differently to earn its place on our best Garmin watches list.

However, after spending around three weeks wearing the watch, including during a marathon, I can confidently say it’s one of the best Garmin has ever made, it feels familiar yet different at the same time, and despite the few changes on paper, the design language is remarkably refreshing it’s more than a simple iterative update.

The AMOLED touchscreen thankfully doesn’t impact the watch’s substantial battery life too badly: even on GPS mode, it’s capable of hours and hours of use uninterrupted, it’ll last around two weeks in smartwatch mode and charges to full power in around an hour. It's not quite the 'unlimited' battery life of the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, but it's still leagues ahead of Apple's best. Although the old digital-watch-style display was always clear to read without feeling like another blue-light-emitting screen on your wrist, the AMOLED touchscreen takes the Forerunner and edges it slowly towards the territory of the best Apple Watch and best Wear OS watch models.

The series feels more like true smartwatch competitors rather than dedicated athletic watches, and very viable alternatives to the Apple Watch Ultra for runners who want to pay less. Either way, the 265 series is, for sure, one of the best running watches out there right now.

Garmin's beautiful new AMOLED touchscreen is on par with any other smartwatch you care to mention, even the best Apple Watch, and still measures battery life in days and weeks rather than hours. The Garmin Forerunner 265S purports to have 13 days of life in smartwatch mode, and up to 25 hours in GPS mode. Time will tell if that's accurate.

Otherwise, there are a few differences beyond the screen that separates the Forerunner 265S from its predecessor, the Garmin Forerunner 255S. There's no dedicated 'music' model to signify that the watch has music storage: that's now baked-in to every model in the updated Forerunner line. It's also got the Training Readiness score and Morning Report features previously available to the 955.

Garmin Forerunner 265: Price and availability

$449 in the US

£429 in the UK

AU$770 in Australia

The Garmin Forerunner 265 and 265S are both priced the same despite size differences. The watches cost $449 in the US, £429 in the UK and AU$770 in Australia.

At present, the watch is available from the Garmin website as well as Amazon and other third-party sites. Don't forget to check out what Garmin promo codes are currently available too.

Garmin Forerunner 265: Design

Screen looks great, with only slight refresh rate lag

Gorilla Glass means it's as rugged as ever

New, larger Run button easier to operate mid-workout

The 265 and 265S watches are only slightly bigger than the 255 and 255S models were, at 46.1mm / 42mm compared the older models’ 45.6mm / 41mm. The screen is eye-popping and absolutely gorgeous: 416 x 416 px or 360 x 360 px AMOLED, with a Corning Gorilla Glass lens to ensure the watch stays rugged and hard-wearing enough to survive adventures and triathlons with peace of mind.

Scrolling through the screens, it's not quite as butter-smooth with its refresh rate as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro or Apple Watch Ultra, but considering it's got around five times the battery life, I can forgive a slight bit of motion blur. You can see the AMOLED next to the old memory-in-pixel format below, side-by-side with the Garmin Fenix 6X:

(Image credit: Future)

The watch packs a slightly redesigned titanium case and bezel, complete with the larger start-stop button in the top right, appropriately redesigned as a Run button. Even though the other buttons are unchanged, the larger profile of your 'main' button is going to make operating the watch quickly during a workout a breeze, even while wearing gloves. It's more or less the only functionality I use on most runs, unless I need to scroll through my navigation options.

The increased real estate of the Run button makes it easier to operate during a workout or while wearing gloves, which reminds me of the Apple Watch Ultra's Action Button, which protrudes from the case to operate on the same principle. I think we're seeing a trend forming among fitness watches right now with big start-stop buttons which are easier to operate while wearing gloves, and I wouldn't be surprised to see other brands follow suit.

Otherwise, the watch comes with new faces such as the one shown, which takes full advantage of the updated screen and the new ability to tap on a feature to bring up the appropriate widget. Scrolling through your options using the up and down buttons on the watch's left-hand-side will be familiar to anyone who's ever used a Garmin watch before: there's no reinventing the wheel here. It's a brighter version of the 255. However, unlike the 255 series, there's no dedicated 'music' model to signify that the watch has music storage: that's now baked-in to every model in the updated Forerunner line.

The ‘whitestone’ color of the smaller Forerunner 265S I was able to briefly get my hands on is complemented by those lime-green undertones in the band, which extends to the underlay in the recesses of the run button. It's a neat design choice, and I think the watch looks great. The larger Forerunner 265, which I wore every day for around three weeks, is matt black with stone-grey undertones in the same pattern.

Design score: 5/5

Garmin Forerunner 265: Features

(Image credit: Future)

Touchscreen is responsive

Training Readiness Score added

Music included

No TopoActive maps

The 265S has a few new tricks, the touchscreen being first among them. This is only the second touchscreen that has arrived on the Forerunner series, the first being the Garmin Forerunner 955 last year. You can use the touchscreen to scroll up and down the list, rather than using the buttons, and a tap to hone in on different features, instead of using the Run button to select. But it's an option, not a requirement: if you're training hard, getting sweaty or wearing gloves, you'll default to using the buttons as normal.

The added Training Readiness score is a feature Garmin implemented last year, again on the 955, and it's good to see it filter down toward the smaller watches. An updated version of the Body Battery score, your Training Readiness score takes into account the intensity of your last few sessions of exercise, your sleep, heart rate, time elapsed between sessions, and so on. It then feeds you an updated score based on how ready for performance your body is likely to be.

It's a really useful feature, and I used it a lot on the 955. During my marathon training block I used the Training Readiness score to understand how long it takes my body to recover from big runs so I can plan my tapering strategy ahead of race day. The other side of the Readiness score is the Morning Report, a push notification sent to your watch as you wake up which tells you your Sleep score, Training Readiness score, weather information and a running workout based on your training history.

It’s a really useful feature, but the Training Readiness score was added to the Garmin Fenix 7 via a firmware update last year. Did we need a whole new watch for it this time?

The other nice thing about the 265 and 265S is that music is included as standard: on the previous models, we had the 255, 255 Music, 255S, and 255S Music. The 265 watches come with 8GB storage, enough for plenty of music to see you through long races. However, this won’t be needed for everyone: as a habitual Spotify user, I tend to only really use my watches for music control rather than storing mp4s and so on.

Otherwise, the 265 doesn't seem to have actively lost any features per se, or slimmed down the number of its available widgets. VO2 max, weather and tide information, the 255's impressive running metrics, and Garmin's state-of-the-art GPS are all here. It's still an awesome watch that's only adding to the already-impressive chassis of the 255. But other than the above, it is the 255: a brighter, sleeker, more attractive version, but a 255 nonetheless.

Features score: 4/5

Garmin Forerunner 265: Performance

(Image credit: Future)

Great race day choice

Simple to use, packed with features

LiveTrack a little buggy

We trialed the Garmin Forerunner 265 for around three weeks, and it’s in daily use that the otherwise small changes listed above make the watch feel fresh and new. The colorful AMOLED screen breathes new life into Garmin’s familiar layout, making heart rate zone graphs, for example, even easier to glance at mid-run. Your eyes are drawn to color, processing color-coded information more efficiently according to scientific research , so one quick glance at your vivid, bright multicolored heart rate graph and your brain will take the information in better than it would on a grayscale MIP.

Otherwise, the watch performed as well as any other watch in Garmin’s stable. I tested the watch’s activity tracking during runs against the GPS on my phone using a competitor app as usual, and found the accuracy in route and time to be exemplary, just like the previous Forerunners. It survived showers and submersion with no issue, and I would be comfortable wearing it during an open-water swim.

During my race, it provided regular times and reports on my progress through my earbuds, and when I no longer wanted to see the race time laid out in its entirety, it took a single button press to change the onscreen view. Incredibly intuitive and easy to do without really thinking about it.

The watch was comfortable on wrist with its soft silicone strap, and although it’s a big watch, it’s not heavy. The 265S is lighter still, making for a comfortable wear on race day. My one missing feature I would add to this watch is TopoActive maps, so you can see terrain easier: on trail runs, they would be both incredibly useful and look ace on the new screen.

(Image credit: Future)

It does come with Garmin’s compass, which operates based on the watch’s rotation and positioning, making it easy to orient yourself, and opportunities to work to find locations based on coordinates. It also comes with TracBack and UltraTrac modes, returning you to the start of your running route. However, TopoActive maps are missed here, although they are present on the Forerunner 965.

LiveTrack is a Garmin feature I’ve used before, which allows contacts listed in your Garmin Connect app to follow you as you run around the course and send encouraging messages to your watch. I did this several times, and for a while it worked a treat.

However, messages came through somewhat sporadically depending on signal, and on one occasion, the map’s English-language captions were replaced with Chinese characters on my wife’s iPhone. I’m currently digging around to see if this is a larger LiveTrack bug, rather than a hardware error, and will update the review accordingly.

Outside of running and trail-finding, the watch looks great and performs well in everyday life. I’ve used it for contactless payments, to accept and reject calls (no speaker or microphone though) and simple one-phrase message replies. Thanks to its redesign and eye-popping screen, it looks and operates with little difference to any common-or-garden Wear OS smartwatch to all but serious gadget geeks.

Performance score: 4/5

Garmin Forerunner 265: Battery Life

13 days in smartwatch mode

25 hours in GPS mode

All claims backed up/exceeded during testing

The Garmin Forerunner 265 is said to last for 13 days in smartwatch mode, and up to 20 hours in GPS mode. The 265S lasts 15 days and 25 hours. These measurements are not great by Garmin standards, but really very impressive for a sub-$500 smartwatch with an AMOLED screen. I’ve found this to be accurate during my testing, as I’ve run for hours with the full-size 265 on GPS mode and barely made a dent in it.

During my training block, the watch lasted around ten days before requiring a change, with near-constant wear and approximately seven hours of running in GPS mode during that period. Recharging the watch to full took around 50 minutes: to do this once every ten days as a keen runner is extremely good.

Battery life score: 4.5/5

If you go the online route with Apple Trade In, the company says ""it generally takes 2-3 weeks"".","Apple has just boosted the trade-in value of some of its most recent iPhones, but not significantly enough to make them good value compared to alternative options.

In the US, Apple's estimated trade-in values for the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 13 Pro have just gone up by $30, and it's also offering an extra $20 for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It's a similar story in the UK only with slightly lower increases – an extra £15 for Apple's two iPhone 13 Pro models, and a mere £5 boost for the iPhone 13 Mini.

These slight raises are a welcome contrast to January when Apple slashed the iPhone prices for its official Trade In program – and it seemingly went a bit too far. It's also worth bearing in mind that these are ""estimated trade-in values"" that, like other trade-in services, will vary depending on factors like your iPhone's condition and specs.

Still, the prices do give us an idea of the maximum trade-in values that Apple's prepared to offer – and those are typically well below the ones you can get from phone carriers, third-party trade-in services, or private selling sites like eBay or Facebook Marketplace. Here are those Apple Trade In price changes for the UK.

To give you an idea, we've compared the potential maximum prices for trading in an iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 with other services below. Apple's prices mostly trail the alternatives, aside from rivals like Carphone Warehouse (in the UK).

This isn't to say that you should never use the official Apple Trade In program – it's still one of the most hassle-free ways of upgrading to a new iPhone, and that's likely why Apple has given its prices a slight boost during a tough time for smartphone sales.

But Apple's program also won't necessarily see your old iPhone recycled. The program's small print says that if your phone's ""in good shape"", it'll ""help it go to a new owner"". And this is partly why Apple's trade-in prices aren't quite as good as alternative options, as there is a cost involved in doing that.

Naturally, the highest possible prices, from going the private sale route, also come with the most potential hassle in the form of fielding questions from buyers and the risk of dispute. But you may find that there's a sweet spot between third-party services and Apple's Trade In prices, even if the latter has been given a slight boost.

There's no single best way to trade in your old iPhone – instead, the options are more on a sliding scale of convenience versus value. The exception is if you have an old device that you're keen to recycle rather than resell, as you'll want to use a trusted recycler like Apple Trade In, EcoATM (in the US), or Fonebank in the UK.

Some programs, like Three's Reconnected and Vodafone's Great British Tech Appeal in the UK, also let you donate your old iPhone to someone in need, which is another good middle ground between selling and recycling.

But if you need the financial boost from your current iPhone to put towards a new option, then Apple's official program in simply one of many options that we've rounded up in our guide to the best Apple Trade In alternatives.

Apple's service can still be a good, hassle-free option – particularly if you do it in-store. If you go the online route with Apple Trade In, the company says ""it generally takes 2-3 weeks"".

Fans or curious users looking to use Bing’s AI search engine don’t have integration within Windows 11 in the capacity seemingly promised by yesterday's announcement.
Windows isn’t doing anything AI related, since Microsoft hasn’t added AI to search on Windows in the new feature drop as you may think, which makes the ChatGPT-powered version of Bing in Windows 11 just feel like an empty advertisement.

The lack of a clear opt-out option does seem to solidify the idea that not only is the ‘shortcut to Bing AI’ here to stay, but it’s only to be accessed on Microsoft’s terms.","Microsoft released a new Windows 11 update on Wednesday, March 1, and all everyone is talking about is how the update emphasises putting artificial intelligence first… and how it falls short of that rather severely.

The AI-powered search box is now set up in the taskbar by default, which may or may not be helpful depending on your disposition towards AI and ‘helpful’ chatbots. The update to the taskbar is amongst many other improved features that are packaged in with the recent Windows 11 update, so it’ll be hard to avoid or ignore if you’re not a fan of ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is the AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI that allows users to interact with the bot and ask it to do anything from brainstorm recipes, breakdown complex ideas, writing and edit large copies of text or just having a little chat. The bot uses machine learning to analyze prompts given by users and respond using data input by the user and information from its database. Microsoft launched its collaboration with ChatGPT early last month and has had its share of meltdowns and inaccuracies since then .

It’s a little too early to get a grasp on how successful this new Windows 11 update has been with integrating ChatGPT-powered AI search, but so far it doesn't seem like the taskbar update has been well received. In fact, I would argue it’s just a heavy-handed advertisement for Bing, Microsoft’s largely unloved search engine, and takes away consumer autonomy to decide whether or not they want to dabble in AI. This is not to bash ChatGPT and its fans, but more a finger wag at the mass implementation that takes away the ability to choose.

Say you were a sceptic or someone who didn’t know much about ChatGPT or Bing AI, you don’t really have a choice on whether or not you want access to Bing AI and there doesn’t seem to be a way to get rid of its addition to your Windows 11 desktop.

The announcement from Microsoft gives off the impression that the entire search experience on Windows 11 will now be supercharged by AI, but that’s far from the case.

There’s no quick search in the taskbar that’ll spit out intelligently thought-out results. Fans or curious users looking to use Bing’s AI search engine don’t have integration within Windows 11 in the capacity seemingly promised by yesterday's announcement. The scale with which AI integration has been promised compared to what we've actually got doesn't match up.

Instead, users now have the ability to launch Bing’s new chatbot without actually having to type ‘bing.com’ into a web browser first. That’s it. The blog post says users have “ the amazing capabilities of the new AI-powered Bing directly into the taskbar “ which is not true at all. You get a banner for Bing on the Windows search page and two prompts to help suggest what to do when you click on any of the related buttons and get whisked off to Microsoft's Edge browser, in what feels like a calculated attempt to force more people to use it.

Once Microsoft Edge is open, you can use Bing as you please if you’re registered. I was taken to the login/registration page since I was yet to make an account, but it‘s incredibly annoying to be sold the idea of having access to Bing AI’s chatbot from the comfort of your immediate desktop and instead being taken to a new program and webpage instead. Windows isn’t doing anything AI related, since Microsoft hasn’t added AI to search on Windows in the new feature drop as you may think, which makes the ChatGPT-powered version of Bing in Windows 11 just feel like an empty advertisement.

Analysis: Who is this for?

This definitely feels like a manifestation of something a lot of people were worried about when Microsoft announced its partnership with ChatGPT and implemented it into Bing: essentially, another way for Microsoft to try to force people into using Bing and Edge in favour of the software they actually use.

We’ve all seen the pathetic little banners that come up on Edge while you’re setting up your PC and trying to download Chrome or Firefox, and this definitely feels like Microsoft has put the metaphorical foot down and made sure that if you want to use your taskbar search or try out Bing AI, you’re going to have to do it on their terms.

Regardless of how you feel about AI chatbots or just AI technology in general, there’s no denying the update to the taskbar is less than useful. There are a lot of more interesting, and useful feature updates that have been overshadowed by the glaring blip of the Bing AI taskbar update.

Bahrain GP: race preview

Max Verstappen has never won the opening race of an F1 season or a Bahrain GP, but he's on pole today. Red Bull have locked out the front row of the grid, with Sergio Perez starting from the second slot, a nose ahead of Ferrari duo Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. Plenty of eyes will be on the man starting in fifth, Fernando Alonso, whose Aston Martin looks very promising indeed. The first race of the season is poised beautifully. It's lights out for the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix at 3pm GMT today.

A superb showing in preseason testing has got Red Bull oozing confidence, though it must be said that the Bahrain International Circuit hasn't been the happiest of hunting grounds for Verstappen. The reigning champion hasn't won the Bahrain Grand Prix in eight previous attempts, with the past two editions proving especially frustrating for the Dutchman.

Big things are also expected of Alonso, who last won an F1 race in 2013. Whisper it, but the Spaniard is finally in what looks like a competitive car again. The Aston Martin is being tipped to be at the head of the midfield this season, and if Mercedes aren't able to get their act together quickly they could even be swallowed up by the team in green.

Equipped with Parallax Correction, the Mini 12’s viewfinder now aligns with the lens – what you see through the viewfinder is what will materialize on your instant prints.

Most instant cameras don’t have parallax correction, meaning the alignment between viewfinder and final print is off. In the case of vertical-format pictures with the Fujifilm Instax Mini 11, you need to be mindful to shift the camera up and to the right a little in order to get the final picture you want.

Accurate composition in the Close-Up mode in particular was always a challenge, but the more you used the Mini 11, the more that reframing became second nature. In the Mini 12’s Close-Up mode, this headache is gone and we expect it will be even easier to use than the Mini 11, which is already one of our favorite instant cameras.

The Mini 12 is available from 16th March 2023 for $79.95 / £79.99 / AU$119.99 – a 15% premium over the launch price of the Mini 11 – and in five different colors including; Blossom Pink, Mint Green, Clay White, Lilac Purple, and Pastel Blue.

A new dedicated app is launched – Instax Up!

Alongside announcing the Mini 12, Fujifilm introduced a new app specifically for its instant cameras – Instax Up! The free app is available now on both Apple App Store and Google Play store.

The app is designed for Instax instant photography with its key functions being to digitally scan, store, and share photos in one place. Users will be able to organize their photos by category, and import other photos from existing Instax apps, including Instax Mini Link.

Other improvements in the Mini 12 include automatic flash control that we believe will detect brightness levels and only fire when needed. The Mini 11 on the other hand fires the flash for every picture whether you are in bright or low light situations.

All of the existing features from the Mini 11 are carried into the Mini 12, including Close-Up/ Selfie Mode and Auto Exposure. The Mini 12 also retains much of the Mini charm, with a bubble-like body and an array of fun colors to choose from.

Atomic Heart was a fun game to sink hours into while I mindlessly chopped down moustachioed robots and ran through rooms looting everything but the kitchen sink.","My wife is dead, and my son has been ripped from my arms by a mysterious kidnapper. Everything I’ve ever known is lost; even my hometown has been obliterated by an atomic blast. I stand by the doors of the fallout shelter and look over the radioactive landscape; I’m exhausted and alone with nowhere to go. But there’s only one thing on my mind.

“I bet there are some cool trinkets in these abandoned houses.”

Why should I spend all my time following the story and trying to rescue my child? It’s been 100 years since my kid was born, so despite entering into cryostasis to keep us all young, he’s technically an old man who should look after himself. Also, I have important business to attend to. Do you think just anyone can find Ashes the Cat or free Billy from his fridge-shaped tomb?

Fallout 4 gave me so many options to explore and loot incredible locations that I eventually forgot about my lost child entirely. Being able to scavenge abandoned power plants, complete side quests for some questionable people, and tough out the atomic conditions of the wasteland was enough fun to keep me occupied for hours. I couldn’t care less about the story if the world is cool enough.

Fallout 4 may not have lived up to the astronomical heights of its predecessors in terms of critical acclaim, but it is a fun game, so nothing else mattered to me. I had forgotten what it was like to just enjoy a game for the sake of it and not because it was a critical success. That was until Atomic Heart came along.

Getting to wander through the eerily picture-perfect streets of Facility 3826 traveling through the skies and beholding the gigantic statues that cut through the clouds, and finally falling to earth and stumbling into the underground barracks was immediately captivating.

Even when I went subterranean, the views stayed stunning. I had to traverse blood-splattered hallways, fungal-infected laboratories, and even large storage rooms covered in this ectoplasm-like gel that I could swim through as if it were water. Every corner I turned gave me something unexpected, and I could never figure out what would happen next.

I felt like I was back in Fallout 4’s wastelands, taking every room, enemy, and quest as it came with no real query about what would happen next. All that mattered to me was that the locations and enemies looked cool, and I could get my hands on some seriously cool weapons and loot.

Attention to detail

Getting to roam all of the brilliantly messy and bloody rooms and the beautiful yet deadly outdoors is even more satisfying, thanks to the brilliant music accompanying my escapades. It’s not every day you get to listen to beautiful retro Russian music in a AA game. But the music was never in question, not with veteran composer Mick Gordon at the helm, who scored Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal.

Atomic Heart was a fun game to sink hours into while I mindlessly chopped down moustachioed robots

I’m also a big fan of eco-brutalist architecture (those are big words for concrete buildings covered in plants), so again, Atomic Heart ticked that box. Seeing architecture so foreign to what I’d usually see in western games was a breath of fresh air; I love swinging around New York as Spider-Man as much as anyone, but that can get old quickly when you’re used to the same old apartment blocks that you can see almost anywhere.

This isn’t to say I loved every small part of Atomic heart. The interactions with some NPCs missed the mark as conversations happened at close to light speed, and the script may not have hit the mark like God of War Ragnarok, but as I said before, that’s not what I came into this RPG looking for.

Atomic Heart was a fun game to sink hours into while I mindlessly chopped down moustachioed robots and ran through rooms looting everything but the kitchen sink. What was I here to do; who could say?

Time to stack some shelves and get on with my job. I can't be caught slacking with boxes scattered all over the shop and shelves needing restocking. So here I am, placing hammers on a shelf, happily getting on with my task when I see something flit across my periphery. Now I’m scared.

Panicked, I speedily load up the rest of the hammers, but it’s too late. Before I know it, a feral granny runs at me, screaming for deodorant. I do the only thing I can think of and throw the box of hammers at her. It works: I have enough time to get out of her old wrinkly grasp.

Running into the center aisle, I see what awaited me in the shadows. Twisted and foaming at the mouth, groups of seething customers tangle themselves around the shelves, poised to jump straight at me. I’m not paid enough for this. I run to the nearest storage room, my safe haven, with hordes of customers clasping at my heels. I enter this dim and damp room and shut the door behind me. I need to rethink my job prospects.

Stocking horror

This small glimpse into the terror that is retail service is Night of the Consumers, and it’s by far one of the most anxiety-inducing horror games I’ve played. You are thrust into your first day on the job, and after a little explanation from your less-than-pleasant boss, it’s time to get to work.

Night of the Consumers plays on the internal terror of being helpless and confused in a retail shop

The aim of the game is simple. Find all twelve boxes scattered around the supermarket, carry them to the designated aisle, and stock the shelves with the products. Unfortunately, the customers in this shop aren’t your model citizens, so they will screech, tackle, and chase you around the store as you try to complete your task. Whatever you do, don't get caught and let the timer run out.

No blood, guts, or horrific supernatural monsters are waiting to drag you into hell. They don’t have to: you’re already there. Instead, Night of the Consumers plays on the internal terror of being helpless and confused in a retail shop. Whether you worked in customer service or remember losing a parent in a big supermarket store when you were younger, many can relate to this horror.

Old-school terror

One of the more charming details about Night of the Consumers is how its graphics style mimics early PS1 games. This blocky and low poly art style adds to the horror as the customers' grinning faces are unnaturally stretched across the character models.

But this retail nightmare isn’t the only game that took inspiration from early days horrors. Another brilliant game in this aspect is Gloomwood. Trapped in a cursed Victorian city, you must navigate the dark pixelated streets of this cursed town and stealth your way out before death catches up. Think Thief but with guns.

There’s also the brilliant Itch.io release of Bloodborne PSX. It has all the great fights and monsters of Bloodborne but with the charming twist of PS1 graphics. Set in another gothic Victorian city, you must survive an onslaught of monsters until morning.

Despite the quality of these two games, I still have to say that Night of the Consumer takes the cake for me. There’s nothing quite like being trapped in a small damp room, rocking back and forth, and stress-eating the stale bread that someone forgot to throw out.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q6rik7X2q9PSxV3bWGhQoD-1200-80.jpg,"{'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q6rik7X2q9PSxV3bWGhQoD-320-80.jpg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q6rik7X2q9PSxV3bWGhQoD-1200-80.jpg', 'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg'}"

PS5 two-minute review

The PS5 had some pretty high expectations to match following the success of the PS4, but it's safe to say Sony's current-gen console has massively exceeded every standard set by its predecessor. There's a huge amount to talk about when showcasing what makes the console so impressive, including everything that comes alongside the console itself.

The DualSense controller is nothing short of a revelation with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. It's a phenomenally clever bit of tech that, in itself, is a selling point for the console. Sony has also since released an upgraded version, named the DualSense Edge, which would've been equally as impressive as its counterpart if not for the eye-watering price.

With the combination of a fresh UI, rapid SSD-fuelled load times, immersive 3D audio, and incredibly powerful hardware, the PS5 takes some generational strides over the PS4. For these reasons and more, once you've started playing the PS5, it's hard to stop.

But there's no avoiding that the console itself is an eyesore, largely due to its wing-like faceplates and bulky size. The plus side to this is that the PS5's gargantuan size ensures that it's quiet and runs suitably cool. You can still place the console vertically or horizontally, though we really wish it didn't need a stand when on its side. More importantly, we haven't experienced any major hardware issues since launch, like hard crashes or storage corruption.

One area where the PS5 has been slow on the uptake is support for the best 120Hz TVs with HDMI 2.1. However, the games that support 120fps is steadily growing, including first and third-party hits like Horizon Forbidden West, Fortnite and Ghostwire Tokyo.

Equally fantastic is the addition of VRR support to PS5. VRR (or variable refresh rate) keeps the action running smooth on compatible TVs. With PS5 VRR enabled, the console is able to maintain high framerates, without screen tearing, and with little to no hits to overall performance. It's an awesome feature we're very happy to see on PS5.

However, you won't need a top-shelf TV to feel the benefits of the PS5’s substantial horsepower. You can still enjoy unbelievably fast load times, significantly better performance, and a greater level of visual fidelity in new and older games alike.

From a simpler setup to a well-thought-out user interface, Sony has also re-imagined the key parts of the user experience with some pleasing extras to boot: PS Plus Essential members can enjoy a curated selection of games straight away, while Plus Extra and Premium can access an additional Game Catalog and Classics Catalog. Backward compatibility also ensures that your old collection of the best PS4 games works on day one.

The end result is a console that we're impressed with, which is ultimately strengthened by the PlayStation 5's compelling line-up of exclusive games that continues to grow.

How to find PS5 in... Our PS5 restock tracker is the best way to get live alerts when there's new stock. We're also rounding up all the future PS5 deals and bundles you can expect so you don't miss a great deal.

We'd love to have seen more first-party games at launch (there were only four if you include pack-in game Astro's Playroom). It would also have been wonderful to see further support for previous generations of PlayStation titles, like PS2 and PS3. Still, the PlayStation 5 feels like a solid investment and with a growing library of the best PS5 games, we're confident this experience will only improve with age.

The library of compelling titles has certainly grown since the PS5’s release. Returnal takes full advantage of the console’s feature set, Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7 both look stunning on the new-gen hardware, while Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a visual spectacle that needs to be seen to be believed.

PS5 one year on (Image credit: Sony) We've updated our PS5 review to reflect our initial impressions after spending two years with the console. Sony has made a few pleasing changes via system updates, and the quality of its exclusive games continues to impress. There are a few outstanding issues, though. The lack of 1440p support continues to frustrate but we'd still fully recommend picking a PS5 if you can find one.

The PS5 caters to people ready to jump into the new generation of video games, alongside PS4 owners who don’t want to leave their collection of games behind. It's a console that seamlessly bridges the gap between the last generation and the new, so you probably won't need to boot up your PS4 ever again.

There's big upgrades like the super-fast NVMe SSD and powerful GPU that enable higher frame rates and ray tracing. But you'll also appreciate the subtle touches like the built-in microphone on the controller that can serve as a quick stand-in for a headset. The PS5 feels like it was built for ease of use as well as pure power.

The PS5 Digital Edition is exactly the same as the standard PS5 but removes the 4K Blu-Ray drive to offer a cheaper price point at $399 / £389.99 / AU$649.95 and a more symmetrical look. We've pitted the two PS5 consoles against each other in this PS5 vs PS5 Digital Edition comparison, so you can determine which one is right for you.

Whichever PS5 model you choose, though, we can wholeheartedly recommend the console as a welcome upgrade over the PS4, and an exciting portal to new-gen gameplay. Read on for our full PS5 review.

Watch our PS5 video review below:

PS5 release date: Out now (released on November 12/19, 2020)

Out now (released on November 12/19, 2020) PS5 price: $499.99 / £479.99 / AU$799.95

$499.99 / £479.99 / AU$799.95 PS5 Digital Edition price: $399.99 / £389.99 / AU$649.95

The PS5 was released in North America, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand on November 12, 2020. It came two days after the release of Microsoft’s new-gen consoles, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For the rest of the world, the console became available one week later on November 19.

For the PS5’s price, it originally cost $499.99 / £449.99 / AU$749.95 for the standard version of the console with a 4K Blu-ray disc drive. However, if that’s more than you want to spend, there’s also the PS5 Digital Edition, which is exactly the same apart from the fact it removes the disc drive entirely. At launch, that cost $399.99 / £359.99 / AU$599.95, which is a saving of $100 / £90 / AU$150 over the standard model.

The PS5 is more expensive than the launch price of the PS4, PS4 Slim, and PS4 Pro, which both came in at $399.99, but they arrived seven and four years ago respectively now, and you're getting a generational leap in hardware here for $100 more. The PS5 is still expensive, don't get us wrong, but the jump in price does feel warranted for what you’re getting.

However, much like the Oculus Quest 2, we've seen the PS5 get a price hike with Sony blaming this on soaring inflation globally. The US remains unaffected but that's gone up to £479.99 / €549.99 / AU$799.95 for the standard PS5, and £389.99 / €449.99 / $649.95 for the digital PS5.

Sony isn't the only console maker with new hardware on the block, though – you also have to consider the Xbox Series X/S, which is the closest competitor to Sony’s PlayStation 5. Priced at $499 / £449 / $AU749 and $299 /£249 / $AU499 respectively, this makes PS5 more expensive than Microsoft's latest consoles, and Xbox won't follow PlayStation with price hikes. Not yet, anyway.

We’ve delivered our verdict in their respective reviews linked above, so we won't spend much time talking about them here. But if you’re interested in how these two compare, be sure to check out our PS5 vs Xbox Series X breakdown for more details.

PS5 review: design

(Image credit: Future)

Huge for a modern gaming console

Space-age aesthetic is polarizing

But the size means more space for air ventilation and a bigger fan

If gaming consoles had weight classes, the PS5 would be in the heavyweight division. We measured it to be around 39 x 10.4 x 26cm (H x W x D) – though the curved surfaces make getting an exact measurement difficult. The PS5 isn’t light, either. It weighs in at 4.5kg, giving it a noticeable heft when you pick it up.

With those measurements in mind, it's easy to see how the PlayStation 5 is the largest console Sony has ever made, and it teeters on the brink of being simply too big for a device that's supposed to sit under your TV. Many will have to rethink their current setup to accommodate Sony's new machine, and that's a problem that no one should have to worry about when picking up a new console.

As for the colors and shape of the console, well, they can be kind of polarizing, too. Some of us on the team absolutely love the PS5 design, while some of us hate the PS5 design. There's no denying, however, that its gargantuan size and two-tone color scheme demands attention in any home. Thankfully, since launch Sony has allowed us to buy new PS5 console covers, coming in five different colors.

One element that's a delightful touch, and universally liked by the TechRadar team, is the system's subtle lighting effect, which creates a soothing hue when the console is in operation or rest mode.

The light strip adds to the PS5's space-age look and feel, and represents a nice touch of continuity from the PS4. Much like the PlayStation 4, when the console is in rest mode the light turns orange, and when the PS5 is turned on it changes from blue to white.

(Image credit: Future)

We’re a bit bemused by Sony's choice to put glossy plastic down the center spine of the console, though, particularly as that's where the front USB ports are located. After over a year of use, we can confirm that the plastic can become scratched over time, even though we were extremely careful when plugging in any devices into the front of the console.

We were worried that this might be the case when we first reviewed the PS5, and we’re kind of surprised that Sony didn’t contemplate this happening during development. The glossy finish is also a big dust and fingerprint magnet, which makes the choice all the more bewildering. Thankfully, it's relatively easy to clean your PS5.

Due to its curves and tall stature, it's not just a case of placing the console down and playing once you pull the PS5 out the box. You'll need to wrap your head around the PS5's attachable stand first, which isn’t exactly the most user-friendly experience.

The console can't be placed horizontally without the PS5’s stand, and you risk impeding airflow if you don't use it when the PS5 is standing vertically. It's an extra step that, while necessary, will hopefully be omitted when the inevitable PS5 Slim version arrives in a couple of years as it’s a bit of a faff.

The stand, while functional, feels slightly cheap in the hand too. It has a small compartment to hold one lone screw (don’t lose this, as you'll need it when placing the console vertically) and at first glance, it doesn't look like the setup will actually work when laying the console flat.

To its credit, though, it does the job in a no-thrills fashion – however, we found the stand slipped off the small lip that it clamps onto multiple times when we shifted our unit into position.

In terms of ports, the front of the PlayStation 5 has a USB-A and USB-C port, while the back sports two USB-A ports, a HDMI 2.1 port, an Ethernet port and a power port. There are no proprietary ports on the console, which is always a bonus if you need to replace the odd cable.

PS5 review: performance

(Image credit: Future)

Capable of 4K/120fps gameplay as well as support for 8K/60

Faster loading times thanks to new SSD

System runs cool and quiet nearly all the time

When it comes to specs, the PS5 is a technically impressive piece of hardware. There's the new custom RDNA 2 GPU that can push 4K resolution at 120 frames per second, and the octa-core AMD Zen 2-based CPU with a 3.5GHz clock speed.

Throw in 16GB of GDDR6 memory and a 825GB NVMe SSD, and this is a machine with some seriously impressive specs. The PS5 is also capable of outputting 8K resolution, however, we'll need to wait for a firmware update from Sony before it's able to do so.

PS5 specs (Image credit: Future) CPU: AMD Zen 2-based CPU with 8 cores at 3.5GHz (variable frequency)

GPU: 10.28 TFLOPs, 36 CUs at 2.23GHz (variable frequency)

GPU architecture: Custom RDNA 2

Memory interface: 16GB GDDR6 / 256-bit

Memory bandwidth: 448GB/s

Internal storage: Custom 825GB SSD

Usable storage: 667.2GB

IO throughput: 5.5GB/s (raw), typical 8-9GB/s (compressed)

Expandable storage: NVMe SSD slot

External storage: USB HDD support (PS4 games only)

Optical drive: 4K UHD Blu-ray drive

In fact, the only real issue we have with the PlayStation 5's spec sheet is the amount of storage available. It's only using an 825GB SSD instead of, say, a 1TB or 2TB SSD. That decision was clearly made to cut down on the cost of the console, but it means that you can run out of storage quickly if you're not being judicious about which games you keep installed.

The console comes with 667.2GB of usable storage, which we found held around 16 games: two PS5 titles, which were Astro's Playroom and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and various PS4 games like God of War and Detroit: Beyond Human. The available space actually went further than we thought, although your mileage will vary depending on the size of the games you have installed.

It may have taken over eight months after launch, but it's now possible to upgrade the internal storage with an NVMe SSD. You can pop off the PS5's plastic faceplates to reveal the empty SSD bay and secure a compatible M.2 SSD in place using a screwdriver. We've rounded up the best SSD for PS5 and created a detailed guide showing you how to upgrade your PS5 internal SSD storage.

Adding more storage via the SSD bay isn't the most intuitive of methods, and feels like a slight oversight on Sony's part - but hopefully, it's only something you'll need to do once. It’s also handy that you'll at least be adding storage onto the existing 667GB, instead of starting from scratch.

The good news is that you're also able to use external hard drives and SSDs by plugging them into the USB port. You won't experience the same lightning-fast load times that you get from the built-in SSD and optional (not to mention locked) SSD bay. But if you use an external SSD, you'll still see a massive boost to load time performance over a regular mechanical hard drive.

We plugged in an external SSD into one of the PS5's USB ports and the process of getting things set up was effortless. The console detected that an external drive had been connected, and once it was formatted, we were able to store and transfer PS4 games to it. After a PS5 system update in April 2021, you can now also store PS5 games or save data to external storage. However, you’ll need to transfer games back onto the internal drive if you wish to play them.

While few of the launch games really gave the new hardware a run for its money, we can already see the potential in Sony's upgraded hardware. Crucially, more titles designed with PS5 specifically in mind are on the way.

Load times are where most new PS5 users will see a stark difference, to begin with. In Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, for example, load times have gone from 15-20 seconds on the PS4 to less than a second on the PS5, and Demon’s Souls takes literally seconds to load entire, sprawling levels. Returnal is another game that benefits greatly from the PS5’s super-fast SSD, with not a load screen in sight as you traverse countless biomes.

Graphical improvements, particularly when it comes to resolution, are the next immediate highlights when it comes to playing on PS5. Astro's Playroom runs at a rock-solid 60 frames per second at a 4K resolution, and almost every title we’ve played is either playable at 60fps by default or provides a 30fps mode with more visual flourishes. It's a dramatic and pleasing shift from the PS4, where games were often 1080p / 30fps.

In the future, more titles will run 4K resolutions at 120 frames per second, too, and there's the potential that less graphically intensive games could reach 8K/60fps. For now, though, we don't expect many games to hit that ambitious target (most will drop the resolution from 4K to achieve a higher frame rate), but there's a chance some titles will be able to achieve that coveted 4K/120fps output down the line.

A small slice of the PS5 launch library supported 120fps, and included Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Devil May Cry V: Special Edition, Dirt 5, Rainbow Six Siege and WRC 9. It's worth noting that you'll need a HDMI 2.1-compliant TV to display the 120Hz refresh rate at higher than 1080p resolution. Here's how to enable 120Hz on PS5.



Unfortunately, we haven’t seen as many 120fps enabled games as we’d hoped since the PS5 launched. Still, things are slowly improving, though you'll find far more 120fps games on Xbox Series X|S.

(Image credit: Future)

So what can you expect if you pick up a PS5 today? For now at least, most games will be capable of delivering 4K resolution at 30fps or 60fps when using a game's Performance Mode (which we'll explain below). Many will also utilize 4K image assets for crisper textures, while HDR support helps to provide better colors and contrast.

Combine that with ray tracing and improved particle effects that are now possible with the current suite of development tools. Games look leaps and bounds better now than they did a decade ago.

Even though not every PS5 launch game will have it, most should feature the aforementioned Performance Mode, which prioritizes higher frame rates over resolution and extra graphical features. With many games, this sacrifices various graphically-intensive effects like ray tracing or higher shadow quality, and drops the base resolution, in order to achieve higher frame rates like 60fps instead of 30fps.

But why would you want the extra frames at the expense of resolution? Well, higher frame rates make games feel far more responsive – which is a must for first-person shooters that require twitch-based reflexes and split-second decisions.

For some gamers, higher frame rates are the holy grail for consoles – something that has been hard to achieve for decades due to weaker hardware. To have this finally be an obtainable goal feels like a monumental achievement, even if it comes at the cost of some graphical flourishes.

If you'd prefer not to use Performance Mode, you can always choose Resolution Mode. This prioritizes higher resolutions, better rendering techniques like ray tracing, and more detailed graphics. We got a taste of that with Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and we loved what we saw. Lighting was improved substantially: windows glistened in the sunlight and contained realistic reflections, and the particle effects looked stunning.

What you can expect from this new generation of gaming, then, is faster load times, better framerates in Performance Mode, and higher target resolutions everywhere else. Simply choose which option you prefer.

How good is PS5's 3D Tempest Audio?

Adjust your 3D audio profile (Image credit: Sony) If you head into the PS5 settings, you can adjust the 3D audio to suit your preference. There are five levels of height to choose from, so select the option that sounds closest to your ear level. Remember that 3D audio works on any headset, either wirelessly or when plugged into the DualSense controller, and can also be enabled using your TV speakers.

The PS5's 3D Tempest Audio is Sony's take on Dolby Atmos, or spatial audio in general. It works on any headset, with 3D audio support for TV speakers now available thanks to a recent update.

We've tested various spatial audio solutions in the past, ranging from Windows Sonic to Dolby Atmos, and we've found that PS5's 3D Audio is a comparable experience overall, though it isn’t quite the revelation we hoped it might be.

We enjoyed hearing ships fly past and over our head in Astro's Playroom, and appreciated being able to pick out thugs that were closing in on us in Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. It's not as detailed or as realistic as Sony made out, though, at least not at this stage, and it will be up to developers to get the most out of the technology as it matures.

Returnal has shown that 3D audio can be a powerful tool when it comes to increasing immersion and that it can also be beneficial in fast-paced games where audio cues are just as important as what you see on screen.

It’s the best implementation of the technology yet, and we hope Sony continues to support it. Right now, these are the best PS5 headsets for 3D audio. You can expect to experience Tempest 3D audio in all of Sony's first-party titles, like Sackboy: A Big Adventure.

(Image credit: Future)

What about heat and noise?

The PS5's monstrous footprint gives it one significant advantage over its predecessor in that the console is basically silent – and heat production is also minimal. We have noticed a bit of coil whine on some units, which is where the console emits a faint electrical noise during certain games, but compared to PS4 it’s a monumental improvement.

The PS4 and PS4 Pro were renowned for their ability to kick up the system fans to obnoxious levels and output lots of heat, particularly on the earlier models, so those looking to pick up a PS5 will be relieved to hear that those problems have been eradicated.

We held our hand near the system during a long play session, and although the PlayStation 5 was clearly outputting hot air (as it's designed to do) it was emitting far less than what the PS4 Pro would push out.

Very rarely in our testing did the fans reach an audibly loud level to the degree that the PS4 Pro did when running games like Horizon: Zero Dawn or God of War. However, that could simply be due to the fact that we haven't seen any resource-heavy PS5 games yet. Sony has also promised that it plans to optimize the PS5's fans using over-the-air updates, so the machine could get louder, or indeed quieter, when playing certain games later down the line.

PS5 review: DualSense controller

New DualSense Controller feels like a revolution over the DualShock 4

Highlights are the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback

Mute button can mute your mic or, if your TV has HDMI CEC, your TV

(Image credit: Future)

To navigate this brave new world of console gaming, you'll need a new gamepad – namely, the new Sony DualSense controller.

You'll be pleased to hear that you get a DualSense controller in the box with your PS5, and the DualSense feels oddly similar in the hand to the DualShock 4 that shipped with the PS4. We found it to be incredibly comfortable to hold for extended periods, and were shocked that when we went back to our trusty DualShock 4, it felt plain wrong to hold after using the DualSense.

Picking it up for the first time, the DualSense is fairly weighty and balanced, with most of the heft resting in the grips of the controller. While the majority of the controller features a matte white plastic finish, the bottoms of the grips themselves have a slightly rougher texture that actually makes the controller easier to hold, and less likely to slip out of your hands.

In fact, if you look closely, the texture is made up of tiny PlayStation face buttons, which is a neat little touch. The two-tone PS5 controller color scheme extends to the four face buttons, which still consist of the classic Triangle, Circle, Square and Cross (or X); however these are now devoid of color, and remind us of the PS Vita's minimalist approach.

(Image credit: Future)

There's a pop of color around the side of the central touchpad, though, as the PS4 Lightbar has thankfully been moved from the top of the gamepad to a less problematic position – thanks to its new placement, you won't now see an annoying glow reflecting off your TV.

Where early PlayStation controllers sported a convex analog design, the PS5 DualSense controller has concave control sticks, just like the DualShock 4, and they feel noticeably more durable this time around, with a pleasing textured finish on the outer ridge.

On early models of the PS4 the rubber analog sticks would sometimes wear away under vigorous gameplay sessions, and we’re pleased to report that even after six months of use, we haven't seen it reoccur with the DualSense. You'll notice a few new buttons you haven't seen before on Sony's new pad, too – like the mute button that turns off the microphone that’s built into the controller.

(Image credit: Future)

When this is held down, it can mute your television speakers or headset, which we found to be a useful quality-of-life feature. When speaking into the mic, we found it worked best when we kept the controller in our usual playing position, instead of holding it towards our mouth. We wouldn’t recommend using the DualSense microphone for voice chat, though – it isn’t the highest quality and has a tendency to pick up a lot of environmental sounds.

The highlights of the new DualSense controller, however, are the adaptive trigger buttons that allow developers to add resistance to certain in-game actions. The adaptive triggers can use resistance to create various sensations that mimic real-life actions, like pushing down on the pedal of a car or pulling back a bow string.

It's a huge step forward for haptics in Sony's hardware, and we found that the haptic feedback itself is a vastly superior replacement for the traditional rumble of old. When a character runs across a certain surface, like metal, it manages somehow to replicate that feeling in the palms of your hands – it's a truly wonderful sensation.

So far, we've seen a variation of haptic feedback support integrated into every PS5 game we've played so far, and hope to see it supported by more games in the future; we expect the feature to shine most in first-party titles, though. Returnal uses the DualSense to great effect, mimicking the effect of rainfall using haptic feedback, and the trigger performing two fire types by pressing it either halfway or all the way down.

Accessibility shouldn't be a concern either, as the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback can be turned off at system level, or adjusted to suit your needs. You can learn how to turn off the DualSense adaptive triggers and haptic feedback here. You can also use a PS5 DualSense controller on PC.

Battery life, so far, has been a massive improvement over the DualShock 4. We played through a handful of PS5 and PS4 titles during our testing, including Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Astro's Playroom, and the controller eventually ran out of charge after 12 hours and 30 minutes. This will obviously vary depending on the types of games you’re playing and how much they use the DualSense’s features, of course, so that 12 hour figure could end up a lot lower.

Still, it's an impressive feat when you consider the DualShock 4 lasted around five to eight hours at a stretch. While internal batteries can degrade over time, it's a strong start for Sony's new pad, particularly when you consider how much technology is packed into it. Of course, you can also use the controller wired if you prefer.

To charge the DualSense, you have two options: either connect it to the PlayStation 5 itself with the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes inside the box, or shell out for the optional PS5 DualSense Charging Station, which can charge two controllers at a time using the metal conduits on the bottom of the pad near the 3.5mm audio jack.

You can also charge the controller, or your USB headset, via the rear USB ports, or opt to use a USB-C to USB-C cable when using the front USB-C port to charge the DualSense controller.

Either option works well, but the Charging Station does certainly look nicer sitting on the shelf, and more cost-effective third-party charging stations will likely become available in the coming months. We'll also need to test whether charging the controller via a USB-C to USB-C cable is quicker than using the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes with the console.

Still, if that doesn't sound entirely appealing, there's always the recently announced DualSense Edge, Sony's rival to the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller and the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. Presenting a more premium build with customizable options and bespoke features, we don't have a release date just yet for this, but we'll keep this updated once we know more.

PS5 review: features

Redesigned user interface with beautiful splash screens for every game

PlayStation button has all new features

Party chat allows you to screen share

Design is one thing, but what can really elevate a console to the next level is its feature set – and thankfully the PS5 delivers here.

The PS5 innovates on what Sony's consoles have done in the past and, as a result, it might take a minute or two to get used to some of the new controls – pressing and holding the PlayStation button on the controller no longer brings up the quick menu, for example, but instead brings up a new Control Center.

This operates in much the same way as the quick menu did, and lets you view various sub-menus such as your Friends list, downloads in progress, notifications and, if you have your account linked, Spotify.

One of the more prominent new features is the PS5's Cards, with the most impactful being Activity Cards. Cards have various functions, allowing you to track trophy progress, jump into specific parts of a game like a challenge or multiplayer mode, see how far along you are on a game level, or simply see news from a developer. You can even watch a livestream of your friend’s gameplay using a picture-in-picture mode, which is pretty cool.

Cards are also present as you delve further into a game’s information, which is now displayed beautifully on the home screen.

By pressing down on the D-pad or flicking down on the analog stick, you can see the available Cards at a glance, circumventing the need to visit a game's main menu or particular mode to find out what's going on. They should prove useful for gamers of a lesser ability, too, as they can contain in-game hint videos in supported titles that help you overcome specific challenges or find that one last collectible.

Since launch, we've already seen Sony retiring this PS5 launch feature, Accolades. Designed as a community awards feature to lets players commend fellow gamers for their assistance, Sony revealed that it hasn't received much use as anticipated, so it's now been dropped.

(Image credit: Future)

Overall, we found Cards to be a useful addition, though horizontally scrolling through each one did feel cumbersome at times.

There's also a slight delay before they appear, which is at odds with the speed of the system as a whole. But, while not essential by any means, they help to add another layer of next-gen gloss to PlayStation 5 experience that you won’t find anywhere else.

Outside of the interface, you can expect the return of groups and other social-based features from the PS4, like SharePlay, as well as easy video sharing. You'll be able to jump straight into the game your friends are playing from the menu, or invite them to larger groups. Video sharing on the PS5 works similarly to how it did on the PS4, but it's nice to be able to see a preview in Cards.

Speaking of social features, if you're tired of typing out messages using a D-pad or analog stick, the PS5 also supports voice dictation for messaging thanks to the DualSense controller's built-in mic. You can also use PS5 voice commands to open games, apps and put the console in Rest Mode.

While your mileage may vary when it comes to the accuracy of the dictation (as with all voice recognition software), it could prove handy when you need to fire off a quick message to a friend. We did find it to be inconsistent in our testing, though, and not as accurate as something like Google Assistant.

We also like the fact you can choose system-wide settings for certain aspects on PS5 such as your preferred difficulty level or whether you invert the x or y-axis on your controller during games. You can even choose which graphical mode you prefer games to automatically select: performance or resolution.

PS5: streaming video services and other apps

(Image credit: Nick Pino)

Of course, game consoles can do more than just provide your thumbs with something to do - modern consoles are also full-on streaming video players.

Right now, you'll find over a dozen supported streaming services on the PS5 including most major services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Peacock and Apple TV, as well as a few more niche services like Twitch, NFL Sunday Ticket, ESPN, Vudu, Tubi, WWE Network and Crunchyroll. The selection here isn't as big as you'd find on, say, a Roku streaming player, but it should be enough for most.

The worse news is that, as it stands, there's no support anywhere on the console for Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision. We thought we might see them appear on launch day, but neither materialized and Sony appears to be shunning the popular HDR and audio formats for now.

What that means, unfortunately, is that the PS5 is really only a middling media player - it can't best dedicated streamers like the Nvidia Shield, Amazon Fire TV Cube, Apple TV 4K or the new Roku Ultra, and isn't the console we'd recommend to our cinephile friends looking to host movie night with the highest fidelity films.

PS5 review: game library

(Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment)

Every PS5 comes with Astro’s Playroom installed

PlayStation Plus Collection is a great introduction to new players

Limited backwards compatibility with PS3, PS2 and PS One games

Most consoles don't launch with a full library of games right off the bat, so the launch bar was pretty low for the PS5. That being said, what you make of the PlayStation 5's current game library largely depends on if you finished the masterpieces from the PS4's era – games like God of War, The Last of Us Part II, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

If you haven't finished them, or haven't played them at all, you could have over a dozen excellent games to play from the second you turn on the PS5 via backwards compatibility, a number of which have been improved thanks to a 60fps update, like Ghost of Tsushima and Days Gone.

If you have PS Plus, you might also have access to some older games that passed you by, as Sony's new PlayStation Plus Collection includes 19 defining games from the last generation that you can download on day one. Every PS5 comes pre-installed with Astro's Playroom, too, and it's a thrilling showcase for what the system can do.

(Image credit: Future)

A fully fleshed-out sequel to Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, Astro's Playroom is a platformer that features exotic locales in which are hidden artifacts from Sony's PlayStation hardware catalog. You'll find a PlayStation VR Aim Controller hidden in a snowbank somewhere in one level, for example, while another level might contain a PlayStation Portable for you to discover.

It's a nice homage to the PlayStation hardware that's come and gone, but we expect some folks will play through it, then uninstall it to reclaim the 10GB of storage space it takes up on the console. You can always re-download it from your games library or the PlayStation Store should you wish to play it again.

But what else is there to play if you pick up a PS5 today? Well, the PS5 library mostly consists of cross-generation titles at the moment and is helped greatly by the fact it’s fully backward compatible with PS4.

However, the list of noteworthy PS5 games is growing and includes some first-party heavy hitters like Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Demon’s Souls, The Last of Us: Part 1, God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, Returnal, and Gran Turismo 7. You can also pick up some big third-party games like Resident Evil Village, Stray, Saints Row, Elden Ring, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

(Image credit: Future)

There are also various independent games that are worth a shout, like the indie charmer Bugsnax (that one with the infuriatingly catchy theme tune), which was available as the console's first PlayStation Plus downloadable game.

We'll continue to keep an eye out for the best PS5 games as the console matures and you can keep track of all the new PS5 games on the way.

PS5: backward compatibility

Those masterpieces that we mentioned earlier? Those are all part of Sony's new PlayStation Plus Collection: a small library of hits from the PS4 that Sony's making free to PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS5.

Some real mainstream classics are included, but also some less-popular gems that are well worth checking out, like Persona 5 and The Last Guardian. The PlayStation Plus Collection might never swell to the size of Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass lineup, but even with the 19 games available right now, it's a great perk for PS Plus subscribers.

What about folks who want to play older games? Well, the PlayStation 5 can play almost any PS4 game but not everything is compatible, though the incompatible games list is miniscule. There's no way to pop in a PS3 disc and have it work or transfer over your PlayStation Classics purchases you made on the PS Vita a few years ago.

We're as disappointed as you are with the lack of backward-compatibility support for Sony’s previous generation of games, particularly as Xbox 360 and original Xbox games (physical discs included) work on the Xbox Series X, but it's not uncommon for a new console to only support the last generation of games as manufacturers look to the future.

It used to be that you could choose select PS3/PS2 titles via PlayStation Now… but that's been replaced with a revamped PS Plus service, which also includes PS1 and PSP games. Accessing your old PS4 games is thankfully a cinch on Sony's new system, though. Simply select the Library icon and the PS5 will automatically pull in all your digital purchases and previously installed games, providing you're signed in to your PlayStation Network account.

You'll need to redownload them to the console, of course, or insert the physical disc to activate a game's license. Some games have been upgraded to run better than ever on PS5, too, like Days Gone, which now runs at a silky-smooth 60fps, while God of War can now comfortably hit its 60 frames per second target using the game’s performance mode.

One thing to note is that you may notice your save file is missing when you boot up a PS4 game that you previously owned for the first time – that's because you'll need to redownload your save files from the cloud onto your PS5 console first. Here's how to transfer PS4 save data to PS5.

PS Plus members have access to cloud saves, but if you haven't been backing up your save files over the air, then you may notice your data won’t be there initially. It's not the most seamless system, admittedly, and is bound to confuse some users, but support for carrying over your save files appears to be there for most of the older titles we tested – however, this will vary on a case by case basis.

Should I buy the PS5?

Buy it if...

You plan on buying a new game console in the next six months

The PS5 is a seriously great next-gen gaming console – and one we’ll be recommending to our friends and families for a while yet. The new controller is revolutionary, and the whole experience feels fresh, fast, and satisfying to use.

You want a taste of current-gen without losing your PS4 games

One of the best things about the PlayStation 5 is that it acts as a bridge between generations. Your entire library of digital PS4 games is there from the moment you log into your PSN account, and any great games you missed will likely be part of the PlayStation Plus Collection.

You're tired of loading screens and ready for higher frame rates

The marquee features of the PS5 are its SSD, which significantly reduces the time it takes for games to start up, and its cutting-edge GPU, which enables ray-traced graphics and resolutions up to 4K at 120fps – and, possibly, all the way up to 8K/60fps in the future.

Don't buy if...

You're looking for a great Dolby Atmos and Vision Blu-ray player

If you're a home media enthusiast who has a collection of 4K Dolby Vision Blu-rays at home and a Dolby Atmos speaker system, you probably won't love the PS5. Yes, it will be able to play 4K Blu-Ray discs, but because it doesn't support Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision's cutting-edge formats, we won't be recommending it to the audiovisual community.

You want to play loads of native PS5 games

The PS5's exclusive game catalog is growing, but still a little on the small side. That doesn't mean things won't improve; they most certainly will, but as it stands, don't expect to be overwhelmed with options.

Your home console setup is cramped already

It might not be an issue for some, but it's worth calling attention to how big the PS5 is one last time. If you're short on space, and you physically don't have room for a gargantuan console on your entertainment center or desk, then you might want to hold off for the smaller version of the PS5 that will inevitably be released in a few years time.

Also consider...

Xbox Series X

Microsoft's flagship console is a great alternative to the PS5 if you prefer games like Halo Infinite and Forza. It also offers unique features such as Quick Resume that lets you flick between several games at a time without having to close them.

Xbox Series S

The smallest Xbox ever made, if you're looking for a gateway into next-gen gaming, the Xbox Series S offers excellent performance for an affordable price. Make sure you pick up Xbox Game Pass, too.

Nintendo Switch OLED

Nintendo's latest iteration of the Switch is the best one yet. With a gorgeous OLED screen, redesigned kickstand and speakers, the Switch OLED is the perfect second system. You can also play it anywhere, anytime.

Indeed, many analyst firms have already identified no-code/low-code as the ‘next big thing’ in software, seeing it as making significant inroads across multiple industries.

Gartner, for example, has predicted that 70% of new applications will use low-code/no-code technologies by 2025, increasing by more than 50% from the previous two years. So what makes low-code/no-code such a game changer for enterprises, and why is now a good time to make the move?

Technology advances against a turbulent economic backdrop

With economic turbulence front and centre for many businesses, and IT costs representing significant overheads, many teams are experiencing budget cuts. However, with digital transformation continuing at pace, it has become increasingly important for enterprises to prioritize both speed and quality to meet customer needs while growing their business and cutting costs. DevOps teams must therefore find new ways to address this in regards to software development, even with fewer resources.

Luckily, recent developments in AI and quality engineering have helped make low-code/no-code platforms more accessible to companies of all sizes. This stands to transform DevOps teams’ capabilities by helping them deploy higher quality software and releases more quickly. Adopting an automated, no-code approach to testing helps businesses improve both the efficiency and security of their software development process. In practice, DevOps teams can do more with less.

Circumventing talent shortages

Quite simply, using low-code/no-code capabilities allows developers to gain an advantage by focusing their custom development on the unique competitive differentiated features versus spending time re-producing existing commoditized functionality. User-friendly technology for quick implementation of testing and project completion means more time for value creation.

Low-code/no-code tools allow developers to transfer the burden of maintenance from themselves to the platform. Unconfined by the systems in place, they can instead focus on more advanced deliverables for each project. This allows other more strategic initiatives to progress and further widen business goals, ultimately driving business value for the organization. Meanwhile, professional developers are free to spend more time with engaging, high-level tasks, resulting in a win-win situation for enterprise and employee alike.

But it’s not just the professional developer community that stands to benefit. Low-code/no-code software enables technical business stakeholders to build and expand enterprise-grade applications at scale with little or no prior coding experience, and without the need for large engineering teams or infrastructure. Configuring tests and instituting software bots to complete tasks that were previously handled by professional developers is greatly contributing to the removal of the skills barriers surrounding delivering technology solutions.

With insufficient numbers of developers available to meet the increasing demand for rigorously tested and quality-built applications, low-code/no-code is helping to address the talent gap. This reduces IT backlog and overall operating costs, saving companies considerable time and money.

Spotlight on software testing

Despite the fact that low-code applications require a less technical skillset, are easier to put into production, and represent a smaller project to develop, these applications have become even more advanced and their lifecycle development increasingly complex.

Application code must still be tested and meet the same standards as fullstack custom applications. So while a single application may not require many resources to implement, organizations that develop multiple applications build further pressure on already thin-stretched DevOps teams.

By using low-code enterprise software testing solutions that require minimal knowledge or experience in the field, DevOps teams can increase the number of employees who are able to support testing activities, bringing business and subject matter expertise to bear more effectively.

With the gap closed between DevOps teams and the rest of an organization and software and testing better aligned, developers can spend more time on the areas that can’t be covered by low-code creation and testing. This means development teams can be allocated to other tasks that will help overcome common bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle.

This streamlined process can also be applied to applications built on a platform rather than in house. Usually, the updates of those platforms are controlled by an external vendor rather than the DevOps team. Some of those adjustments can affect the functionality of the apps running on top of them, meaning that DevOps teams also have the extra workload of checking new functions and evaluating their use for the organization. But, most crucially, they must also ensure that the update did not break any of their existing customizations. The level of work created by these verification checks increases exponentially with the number of platforms in use.

Low-code automated testing solutions however can cut the time spent verifying platform updates significantly. The tests require little time to set up, meaning that risks associated with a platform update can be managed quickly and easily. By leveraging low-code/no-code technologies to cut out the complexity, teams no longer need to only depend on release notes to understand why their app may no longer work as expected. Pairing the simplicity of a platform with the inherent accessibility of low-code/no-code technologies allows DevOps teams to maintain constantly changing workflows with the same levels of high-quality software.

Challenges identified

Although there are many advantages to adopting low-code/no-code software development, the limited functionality of low-code has proven to be an issue for some applications that require further customization. If unique functionality is necessary and isn’t available in the low-code/no-code platform, a software development team will still need to intervene and write custom code. Integrating the customized code itself can be costly and time consuming for the organization, however.

These issues pave the way for the use of code-friendly applications, where teams can employ record and script enhancement features to fix performance issues before they become a larger and more costly bottleneck, allowing them to check that the application performs correctly.

Doing more with less

Creating customized software solutions at scale has traditionally required large engineering teams to keep up with the pace of development without sacrificing quality. With the pace of digital transformation not slowing down amid today’s unstable economy and employment market, businesses are having to rely on smaller teams to scale the value of their solutions to a greater number of customers - or worse, do all this whilst also cutting back on budget.

Low-code/no-code software testing solutions now enable these thinly stretched teams to do far more with less, achieving the previously impossible concept of quality at speed. Moreover, by leveraging these user-friendly, accessible technologies, they are able to bridge the talent gap and bring expertise from other areas of the business into play for a more efficient development process.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCTNYiYfPTXvyGN9tBArjh-1200-80.jpg,"{'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCTNYiYfPTXvyGN9tBArjh-1200-80.jpg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCTNYiYfPTXvyGN9tBArjh-320-80.jpg'}"

Asmussen has a history of optimism when it comes to the series. Even before the release of the original Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, developer Respawn Entertainment was discussing the possibility of a sequel. “We were already talking about a second game… frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we’re breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it’s like: ‘well, where are we going with the second game?’.”

Though no concrete details have emerged as to what the series’ third act might look like, it is promising to know that Respawn has been looking ahead with the Star Wars: Jedi series ever since the early days. It suggests that we may well be in for a coherent three-part story – in stark contrast to some Star Wars trilogies I might name.

I have a good feeling about this

Judging from trailers and gameplay footage, Jedi: Survivor already looks the part of a trilogy’s dark second act. Everything from Cal’s more grizzled appearance to the more sinister tone has caused me to draw parallels between the game and The Empire Strikes Back, the gritty middle of the original trilogy of Star Wars movies.

The Star Wars: Jedi series is certainly among the more interesting and thoughtful Star Wars projects out there at time of writing. Much to my delight, it’s set between Emperor Palpatine’s rise to power and the events of the original movie trilogy, much like fan-favorite series Andor.

I thoroughly enjoyed Fallen Order’s unflinching look at this dark era in Star Wars history. Cal regularly had to contend with the authoritarian jackboot of the Empire, fending off Stormtroopers and dealing with Darth Vader’s Inquisitors – tortured practitioners of dark force powers hell-bent on slaughtering every last Jedi.

Now that Cal has come into his own as a character, I’m very excited to see what Respawn does in this new narrative space. Hopefully, Asmussen will be able to realize his vision for a trilogy and treat us all to more gritty Star Wars goodness.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7o6GEuH4EDgJumUfwXWtc-1200-80.jpeg,"{'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7o6GEuH4EDgJumUfwXWtc-1200-80.jpeg', 'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7o6GEuH4EDgJumUfwXWtc-320-80.jpeg'}"

Most online competitive titles now have an Olympic games equivalent.","The International Olympic Committee has announced the Esports Series for 2023. This competition will cover a wide range of online games and will have live finals in Singapore from June 22 to 25.

Some games set to feature in the Series include dancing game Just Dance, online motorsport racing title Gran Turismo 7 , and the virtual cycling game Zwift. These are the group's big hitters, but games are more traditional to the Olympic spirit, like virtual Taekwondo and Tennis are also present.

“The Olympic Esports Series 2023 marks another step in supporting the development of virtual sports”, the IOC said in a blog post . “The collaboration with gaming and esports communities will create new opportunities for players and fans alike”.

Is this really esports?

(Image credit: Ubisoft Entertainment )

The addition of esports to the Olympic games is an exciting and encouraging step forward for competitive gaming. However, I can’t help but think that this roster of games misses the mark.

It’s equivalent to a singing competition where contestants can read the lines in front of them

When I think of esports, my mind immediately goes to competitive FPS titles like Overwatch 2 and CSGO or fighting games like Tekken and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate . I can’t say that the online archery and tic tac toe mobile game of Tic Tac Bow is my first thought when it comes to riveting esports gameplay.

Even Just Dance in all its glory doesn’t scream competitive esports to me. These competitors will be doing physically exhausting activities, with the only difference between this and regular competitive dancing being that a screen is involved. To me, it’s equivalent to a singing competition where contestants can read the lines in front of them.

Of all the options available, Gran Turismo 7 is the only title I feel is justifiably cut from the esports cloth. This fast pace racing game brings its own identity to the Olympic games, as motorsport isn’t already an event, while showcasing the skillset and intensity needed for online gaming.

Out of options

(Image credit: Ubisoft Entertainment )

It would be nice to see more generic esports titles arrive at the Olympics, not only to better represent what the sport is like but also to help the IOC modernize their competition.

However, I think that ship has sailed. Most online competitive titles now have an Olympic games equivalent. Whether this is the Overwatch World Cup or the League of Legends World Championships, there are already lucrative and notorious competitions for fans and players to sink their teeth into.

It really does seem like the IOC is stuck with the runt of the litter that doesn’t massively fit the bill. Nevertheless, I’m sure that they’ll make the best of the situation. After all, who doesn’t want Titanium performed on the big stage for everyone to see?",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gXX9ZzFeoLnPBYxZ8fSiqB-1200-80.jpg,"{'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gXX9ZzFeoLnPBYxZ8fSiqB-320-80.jpg', 'https://www.techradar.com/media/img/missing-image.svg', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gXX9ZzFeoLnPBYxZ8fSiqB-1200-80.jpg', 'https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/models/hlwce5dqzq4wsnmg-16040076574048-250-80.jpeg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg', 'https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg'}"

The best overall Xbox Series X headset

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if ✅ You value comfort: Soft, cooling ear pads that suit glasses wearers and people with head’s of all sizes and a decent headband make for long-lasting comfort ✅ You appreciate ease of use: Hassle-free, high-quality audio that will pair to an Xbox on a button-press? It’s an unfortunately uncommon dream.

Don't buy it if ❌ You live in a loud area: There are a few weak points on this headset, and just one or two critical hits are liable to render the whole thing useless if you’re not careful

The Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 Wireless is our number-one pick for the best Xbox Series X headset on the market right now. That's because this particular model is not only aggressively priced, they are exceedingly comfortable to wear and feature a slick design that's immediately eye-catching.

With a sticker price of $150 / £120 / AU$249, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 doesn't break the bank too badly either, and is surprisingly feature-rich. You can expect a battery life of around 20 hours meaning you won't have to charge it up after every play session. It's a sure-fire step up from your average wireless headset aimed at the Xbox platforms but doesn't quite take the leap into audiophile/enthusiast territory, making it far more accessible to the wider gaming market.

As with some other Turtle Beach models, mostly from the Recon line, you've got the various different onboard settings to tailor your experience with the most notable of which being the 'Superhuman Hearing' mode which amplifies some things such as gunshots and footsteps - ideal for competition. In terms of an encompassing headset experience that hits all the right notes, this model does everything you would expect at its price point and much more, too, making it our top choice this year.

The best official Xbox Series X headset

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if ✅ You’re ready to go wireless: The Xbox Wireless Headset means you can finally cut the cord and game without wires getting in the way. ✅ You love bass: These headphones deliver rich, powerful bass which is free from distortion.

Don't buy it if ❌ You want better mic monitoring: Overall, the Xbox Wireless Headset's mic monitoring is its biggest weakness.

Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Headset is easily up there as one of the best Xbox Series X headsets. That's because this officially licensed model features incredible sound quality, narrative pairing with the system itself through wireless and Bluetooth, as well as some great quality-of-life inclusions all at a superb price point.

The Xbox Wireless Headset is priced at $99 / £89 / AU$149 making it one of the better value-for-money propositions available on the platform. Of course, competitive pricing wouldn't mean much if it didn't sound the part, and fortunately, these headphones certainly do. We've been continuously impressed by the prominent bass and the balanced sound profile, delivering strong performance in the low-end and mids, too.

You'd be forgiven for thinking that this headset could be too bass-heavy for certain titles such as story-driven experiences and competitive shooters. Well, Microsoft thought of that as well. That's because there are six customized EQ settings ready to go straight out of the box tailored to a wide variety of games. The headset also features Dolby Atmos support for truly immersive audio performance.

The best high-end Xbox Series X headset

(Image credit: Future)

3. Turtle Beach Stealth Pro The best high-end Xbox Series X headset Our expert review: Specifications Connectivity: 2.4 GHz Wireless; Bluetooth; USB-C Battery life: 2x swappable 12 Hour battery packs Features: 50mm drivers; active noise canceling; memory foam Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Best Buy Reasons to buy + Leading active noise canceling + Supreme comfort + Hand-tuned 50mm audio drivers Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Average microphone performance

Buy it if ✅ You want a premium-sounding and feeling headset: The Turtle Beach Stealth Pro sounds excellent whether you’re gaming or listening to music on any device you can throw its way. ✅ You play on different consoles and PC : If you’re someone who enjoys gaming on PS5, Xbox Series X as well as PC then you’ll be able to make the most out of this headset’s capabilities regardless of platform.

Don't buy it if ❌ You’re on a budget: There’s no getting around the fact that at $329.99 / £279.99, the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is a steep price to pay for a gaming headset even at the top-end of the market.

There's very little we can fault the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro on in terms of design and performance when it comes to the best Xbox Series X headsets. Armed with excellent hand-tuned 50mm audio drivers, leading active noise canceling, and a truly premium design, this really is the be-all and end-all when it comes to the top-end of models on the platform.

Priced at $329.99 / £279.99 / AU$599.95 (with Australia receiving the headset in May), the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is a seriously expensive option for the Xbox Series X. It really is a case of you get what you pay for with this one, though, as no other console-focused offering does what this one can. From the stellar sound quality, which is further brought out by Dolby Atmos, you're getting a sonic range that few can rival in 2023.

What's particularly special about the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is the level of customization on display. Through the Turtle Beach Audio Hub available on iOS and Android, you're able to tweak every aspect of the audio setup once connected to the wireless transmitter. This means you can dial in a particularly weighty EQ to really sell the weight of shooters and driving games available, or dial up the 'SuperHuman hearing' for the competitive edge in some of the best FPS games on Xbox.

The best Xbox Series X headset for battery life

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if ✅ You appreciate dedicated chat mix controls: When Xbox gaming, it’s great to be able to use the SteelSeries Arctis 7X ChatMix dial to fine-tune the balance between gameplay and party chat sound levels. ✅ You need a headset that doesn’t break the bank: It’s not a cheap headset, but it isn’t quite the bank-breaker that its varied feature list would otherwise suggest.

Don't buy it if ❌ Music is your jam: There are better headsets when it comes to musicality. The SteelSeries Arctis 7X is fine for tunes, but lacks the detail and depth that some pricier hi-res headsets deliver.

The SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless certainly lives up to the promise of delivering extensive battery life through 2.4 GHz wireless adapter, with a quoted lifespan of around 25 hours playback. In our testing, we found that the SteelSeries Arctis 7X largely met this figure when gaming and enjoying media, though this set is definitely more suited to the former activity than the latter.

With a price tag of $149 / £174.99, the SteelSeries Arctis 7X isn't exactly the cheapest Xbox Series X headset on the market, but we believe its versatile nature, outstanding build quality, and stellar audio profile more than justify this rate. That's because you're getting full support with USB-C devices (as well as an adapter for USB-A) and a propriety cable along with the standard 3.5mm jack. This means that while it's excellent for Xbox, you can also make use of this set on your other devices as well.

It's the faithful directional audio and crisp profiles that impressed us the most in our testing, though. We found that gunfire and explosions punched through the haze in competitive gaming sessions, but dialogue was picked up effortlessly, too. The same can be said of the built-in microphone which is one of the better ones we've put through the paces recently.

The best wired Xbox Series X headset

(Image credit: Future)

5. Fnatic React Plus The best wired Xbox Series X headset Our expert review: Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Connectivity: 3.5mm Cable length: 1.6 m (5.2 feet) Features : 53mm custom drivers; 7.1 surround sound Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Pinpoint sound accuracy + Superb microphone + Versatile connectivity Reasons to avoid - No mic monitoring

Buy it if ✅ You’re a gamer who loves competitive games: The Fnatic React Plus are specifically designed to help you get the drop on your opponents. Though the drivers are tuned to help emphasize footsteps, they never sounded harsh or lacking depth. ✅ You love chatting with your friends: If you’re the kind of gamer who regularly jumps in a party to chat with friends, the boom microphone on the Fnatic React Plus is worthy of the “broadcast quality” marketing claim.

Don't buy it if ❌ You plan on listening to music

The Fnatic React Plus sound great when gaming, but when listening to music they’re rather underwhelming.

In terms of well-priced and fully-featured options for competitive gaming, the Fnatic React Plus is an easy contender for those wanting the edge in online multiplayer. This wired gaming headset features Dolby Atmos support for 7.1 simulated surround sound. We're also huge fans of the unique black-on-orange aesthetic this headset is rocking.

With a price point of $74.99 / £84.99 / AU$140, the Fnatic React Plus is one of the more affordable gaming headsets available from a big-name brand. Most in the scene will know Fnatic as the long-running eSports organization, so we think they know a thing or two about how to develop audio solutions for competition. This is reflected in the audio performance, with tight bass and a smooth sound profile throughout our testing.

What we also like about the Fnatic React Plus is the microphone. It can be challenging at the best of times to be heard amongst intense firefights when calling out to your teammates. That's not the case with the detachable mic found here, with the cardioid pickup and pop filter doing an excellent job of ensuring we were heard at all times without issue. Given all these offer, we think they are ideal for those more full-on multiplayer titles such as Halo Infinite and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

The best budget Xbox Series X headset

6. Nacon RIG 300 Pro HX The best budget Xbox Series X headset Our expert review: Specifications Connectivity: Wired Battery life : N/A : Reasons to buy + Very affordable + Lightweight, comfy build + Serviceable mic Reasons to avoid - Relatively short cable - Occasionally muddy audio

Buy it if ✅ You’re on a strict budget: Solid quality matched with affordability means the RIG 300 Pro HX comes highly recommended within its price range. ✅ You like longer gaming sessions: With a high level of comfort provided by its plush earcups, the headset won’t irritate at all during longer sessions.

Don't buy it if ❌ You’re after something more feature-rich: The RIG 300 Pro HX is still quite basic, and lacks many of the features provided by pricier headsets.

The cheapest of the RIG series, Nacon's RIG 300 Pro HX is certainly no slouch. Design-wise, you're getting a surprisingly high level of comfort and solid build build quality. It has a chunky, early 2000s aesthetic that won't be for everyone, but certainly stands out from the pack.

The Nacon RIG 300 Pro HX is a very easy Xbox Series X headset to recommend. The ultra-low price point of $29.90 / £29.99 (around AU$44.89) is eye-catching, but the headset still packs the good at that low price. Expect solid (if occasionally muddy) audio and more than serviceable mic quality, making it an excellent choice as a backup headset for use with friends, or as a primary one if you're on a strict budget.

The mic itself is quite stubby, and doesn't look too appealing. But rest assured it is of a decent quality. There isn't really any one aspect of the RIG 300 Pro HX we'd consider to be poor. It's all just a very solid headset with a high level of comfort. Though, we're not entirely thrilled with the length of the cable, which definitely could be longer given it's wired only.

Best Xbox Series X headsets - FAQs

We've utilized our knowledge and personal experience to answer some of the internets burning questions on exactly what makes the best Xbox Series X headsets worthwhile for the platform.

Will my Xbox One headset connect to Xbox Series X? Yes, most headsets designed for Xbox One will work on Xbox Series X, largely thanks to Microsoft's focus on cross-compatibility. Still, we think it's worth looking beyond your workhorse headset for one that's designed with Xbox Series X in mind, as you may find a few extra features that work great on the current-gen system.

Is it best to have a wired or wireless headset for Xbox Series X? Whether you should have a wired or wireless headset depends on your setup and personal preference. While wired headsets mean you don’t have to worry about battery life during long sessions, having a wireless headset will prevent clutter and long wires depending on how far your console is from your seat. Of course, the Xbox series X supports a 3.5mm jack alongside 2.4GHz wireless Bluetooth, so there’s nothing to stop you from trying both and seeing what suits you best.

Do I need a headset for the Xbox Series X? Headsets aren’t essential to gaming with an Xbox Series X, but they can positively alter the experience. A headset will provide a better sense of immersion and help experience sound that may have been missed without one. So while you don’t need one to enjoy the best Xbox Series X games, it’s worth considering getting one if you spend a lot of time gaming.

How we test the best Xbox Series X headsets

We make sure to test the best Xbox Series X headsets thoroughly before considering whether or not to place them in this list. There's plenty of headset brands available on the console, including Turtle Beach, Fnatic, SteelSeries and Xbox's own-brand cans. With so many options, it's important to highlight the ones that're really worth your time and money.

We test Xbox headsets in a variety of ways. Audio quality is typically the first port of call. But we also consider battery life, connectivity, build quality, ease of use and of course, the price. The best Xbox headsets will strike a strong balance in all areas, or provide a seriously high quality experience in one or two areas.

Most of the best Garmin watches feature a memory-in-pixel, or MIP, display rather than the smooth AMOLED screen common on other smartwatches. Both the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and Apple Watch Series 8 use AMOLED displays, and this update brings the Forerunner series in line with some of the other best running watches and best smartwatches on shelves right now.

The Garmin Forerunner 965 is also slightly bigger than its predecessor, the Garmin Forerunner 955, with a 47mm case and a 454 x 454 px screen measuring 1.4 inches, rather than the 1.3-inch display used by its predecessor. The larger size of the 965 also means a redesigned watch case and titanium bezel, and that start-stop button in the upper-right is now bigger, appropriately labeled ‘run’. After all, it’s what you’ll be using to start your runs.

The Forerunner 965 features up to 31 hours of battery life in GPS mode and up to 23 days in smartwatch mode. As well as the standard black and whitestone colors, it also packs a very attractive 'amp yellow' option.

The Garmin Forerunner 265 also packs that redesigned ‘run’ button, the beautiful AMOLED touchscreen (the 255 was buttons only), and incorporates Garmin’s Training Readiness score, which was not available on its predecessor, the 255.

The Training Readiness score debuted last year on the Garmin Forerunner 955 – it’s an updated version of Garmin’s Body Battery metric, which takes into account your recent training efforts, sleep score and time spent at rest in order to determine how intense your next exercise session should be. For example, A Training Readiness score of 55, or ‘Moderate’, means you’re probably fit for mild-to-strenuous exertion, while a score of 30, or ‘low’, means you should take a rest day.

The Garmin Forerunner 265 comes in two sizes, the 46mm 265 and the smaller 42mm 265S (pictured below and above). The 265s features up to 24 hours of battery life in GPS mode and up to 15 days in smartwatch mode, while the larger 265 offers up to 20 hours of battery life in GPS mode and up to 13 days in smartwatch mode.

The watches are priced at $$599.99 for the 965, and $449.99 for the 265. We’ll update this article with full prices for the UK and Australia as soon as the news breaks.

Other than the screens and the features mentioned above, little else has changed between these watches and the last generation of Forerunners, which arrived in June last year. They pack the same chipsets, satellite connectivity, notification functionalities, and training functions as the 955 and 255. There was a three-year gap between the release of the ‘45 and ‘55 Forerunners, so these iterative updates less than a year after the release of the 955 and 255 is a surprise move by Garmin.

The Epix series is essentially the Garmin Fenix series with the same beautiful AMOLED screen, so Garmin has previous form for getting mileage out of slapping a new screen onto an existing model.

However, the fact that Garmin has released two new entries in its Forerunner series mere months after their predecessors is an interesting move, and I previously wondered if this signals the start of a pattern of smaller, annual updates, along the lines of Apple’s update cycle for the Apple Watch.

As it is, I’ve been somewhat spoiled by Garmin’s less regular but more substantial updates, so I can’t help but feel underwhelmed at the lack of any real change here.

Users who recently bought the 955 and 255 thinking they were picking up Garmin’s latest tech will likely feel short-changed. The Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar was my pick for watch of the year in 2022, even with a MIP screen, so although I’m excited at the prospect of an even better-looking version of my favorite wearable, I don’t believe that anyone who owns the 955 or 255 will be convinced to upgrade just yet.

The PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X have an average selling price of $499 to $500, meaning there is hardly anything between their average cost, but on average the Xbox Series X comes in slightly cheaper.","Having one of the best gaming consoles in 2023 is essential if you're looking to keep up with gaming trends and experience all current-gen titles to their highest standard. The current generation of consoles offers an impeccable experience that is hard to beat, so if you're looking to upgrade your setup then it's worth knowing your stuff before shopping.

1. PlayStation 5 The best gaming console Our expert review: Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications CPU: AMD Zen 2-based CPU with 8 cores at 3.5GHz (variable frequency) GPU: 10.28 TFLOPs, 36 CUs at 2.23GHz (variable frequency) GPU Architecture: Custom RDNA 2 'Oberon' Memory interface: 16GB GDDR6 / 256-bit Memory bandwidth: 448GB/s Internal storage: Custom 825GB SSD Usable storage: 667.2GB IO throughput: 5.5GB/s (raw), typical 8-9GB/s (compressed) Expandable storage: NVMe SSD slot External storage: USB HDD support (PS4 games only) Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-ray Drive (for standard edition) Today's Best Deals View at Dell View at Best Buy View at Amazon Reasons to buy + 4K/120Hz support + The DualSense controller is excellent + Fast and beautiful system U.I. Reasons to avoid - Large size - The internal drive fills up fast - No Dolby Vision or Atmos support

Now well into its second year on the market, the PS5 is easily the best Sony console you can buy right now for its suite of incredible exclusive titles and powerful performance. We've been consistently impressed by just how capable this machine is, and the prowess of stellar software has been backed up by some excellent hardware, too. In particular, the DualSense controller is easily in a class of its own and truly delivers that real, immersive cutting-edge feel.

Some of the best PS5 games are those which push the expectations of modern titles. This is achieved not just through the likes of ray tracing, but also with the elimination of the long loading times of yesteryear. Although the console comes packed in with a relatively limited 667.2GB of usable space out of the box (from the quoted 825GB), an SSD for PS5 can go a long way to alleviating this issue and get you enjoying some top-tier titles in the full splendor of native and dynamic 4K.

The PS5 is a powerful console offering a sublime current-gen gaming experience PS5 review

Priced at $499.99 / $479.99, the PS5 really sets itself apart as a true value proposition given the power it possesses. You can maximize your gaming experience in more ways than relying on buying discs or digital copies of new titles, too. That's because the revised PlayStation Plus features the Game Catalogue, which gives you access to over 400 games spanning the wider PS brand over the decades. What's more, essentially all PS4 games work on the system as well, whether you've downloaded them through the PS Store in the past or have kept the cases around.

We're very much just scratching the surface of what's possible with PS5, though. PSVR 2 is scheduled to launch in February, so couple this emerging virtual reality tech with the ability to play in up to 4K120 / 8K60, and you've got the makings of a system that's only just begun to flex. If you want stellar visuals, incredible performance, and games you won't find anywhere else then Sony's latest is the system to keep in mind.

2. Xbox Series X The most powerful gaming console Our expert review: Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications CPU: 8x Cores @ 3.8 GHz (3.6 GHz w/ SMT) Custom Zen 2 CPU GPU: 12 TFLOPS, 52 CUs @ 1.825 GHz Custom RDNA 2 GPU Die Size: 360.45 mm2 Process: 7nm Enhanced Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320b bus Memory Bandwith: 10GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s Internal Storage: 1TB Custom NVME SSD I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s Expandable Storage: 1TB Expansion Card (matches internal storage exactly) External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD Support Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-ray Drive Today's Best Deals View at GameStop View at Amazon View at Microsoft US Reasons to buy + Game Pass is amazing + Dolby Vision and Atmos support + 4K/60fps gameplay (4K/120Hz support) Reasons to avoid - The exclusive library is lacking - Minimal U.I. improvements

From a raw technical perspective, the Xbox Series X is the most powerful gaming console currently available, and it is enhanced by the stellar implementation of both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision which makes Xbox Series X games look and sound phenomenal. Now, over two years since the release of Microsoft's tower of power, we're starting to see what the machine is really capable of; pumping out incredible visuals and offering excelling performance across the board.

Priced at $499 / £449, the Xbox Series X is easily able to stack up to what the gaming PC scene is currently offering. That's thanks to its HDMI 2.1 compatibility, meaning up to 4K120 or 8K60 support, and means you also aren't missing out on features such as ray tracing, too. You just won't the performance on display at this price point, which makes Microsoft's latest a real juggernaut that's sure to stand the test of time. What's more, as the system utilizes Gen 4.0 NVMe SSD tech, it isn't slowing down any time soon.

The Xbox Series X utilizes its powerful specs to significantly reduce load times and improve game performance and visual fidelity Xbox Series X review

While the Xbox Series X may, arguably, not quite compare in the exclusives department to Sony's frontrunner, we think it's fair to say that team green pulls ahead with its ace in the hole - Game Pass Ultimate. Some gamers may never put a physical disc into their machine with the arrival of what can easily be considered one of the best investments in gaming right now. Through this service, you've got access to not only new Xbox Series X titles, but those all generations of Xbox available in its over 20-year history.

That's not to say that the Xbox Series X lacks compelling software of its own, of course. You've got the great heights of Halo Infinite as well as the blistering trails blazed by Forza Horizon 5 as well. Alternatively, you can take to the skies in the hardware-intensive and stunningly beautiful Microsoft Flight Simulator, too. Of course, multi-plats are going to look and run great on this machine as well, but these are some of the experiences that you're just not going to find from Sony - especially if you're not into PC gaming.

3. Xbox Series S The best affordable gaming console Our expert review: Specifications CPU: 8-core 3.6GHz (3.4GHz with SMT) custom AMD 7nm GPU: 4 teraflops at 1.565GHz RAM: 10GB GDDR6 Frame rate: Up to 120fps Resolution: 1440p with 4K upscaling Optical: No disk drive Storage: 512GB NVMe SSD Usable storage space: 364GB Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Sam's Club US View at Macy's Reasons to buy + The smallest Xbox ever made + Plays all Xbox Series X games + Completely silent in operation Reasons to avoid - No 4K - 512GB SSD fills up fast - No disc drive

Now that the Xbox Series S has been available for well over two years, availability has stabilized to the point where we're even seeing further discounts on the budget-minded games console, too. With its competitive price point of $299.99 / £249.99, the system has frequently been discounted to as low as $249.99 / £199.99 making for a value package that's hard to argue against.

Keep in mind that you are making a number of concessions in the aggressive price point with the Xbox Series S as it falls behind its larger sibling in a number of ways. For a start, the machine lacks a physical disc drive and is limited to 1440p instead of the 4K of the Xbox Series X.

The Xbox Series S is a great entry point into new-gen gaming for those who have no qualms about buying games digitally or subscribing to Xbox Game Pass Xbox Series S review

The 512GB SSD here also may begin to fill out quicker than expected if you're downloading beefier titles that are available on Xbox Game Pass, too. Still, that's nothing that the likes of a Seagate Xbox Storage Expansion card can't solve. That's still enough room for some of the service's better titles all in one place.

The bottom line here is that you're paying roughly 2/3 the price for the Xbox Series S and still getting to enjoy all the great current-generation Xbox games. This means that whether you're after a media streaming center for the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus, the target resolution of this console will make images look far crisper than the standard 1080p picture.

4. Nintendo Switch OLED The best handheld console Our expert review: Specifications Dimensions: 4 x 9.5 x 5.4 inch(W x L x H) with Joy-Cons GPU: 768MHz (docked)/307.2MHz (undocked) Nvidia custom Tegra SOC RAM: 4 GB Max Resolution: 1080p (docked); 720p (handheld) Optical Drive: None Storage: 64GB (expandable with MicroSD) Portable battery life: approx 3 - 7 hours Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Target View at Macy's Reasons to buy + Large 7-inch screen + Beautiful and vibrant OLED display + Enhanced speakers and kickstand Reasons to avoid - No upgrades in TV mode - Processing power is the same

The Nintendo Switch OLED is easily the definitive model out of the company's current console lineup. While it boasts the same internals as the stock model, the biggest upgrade with this revision is the screen itself. That's because the larger 7-inch OLED display really makes the most of the admittedly limited processing power which has remained the same for over five years now. Still, as far as handheld and home console hybrids go, you won't find better than this one for the money.

If you’re a first-time Switch buyer this is undoubtedly the model to buy Nintendo Switch OLED review

With its $349.99 / £299.99 asking price, the Nintendo Switch OLED positions itself as significantly cheaper than the current leading models from Sony and Microsoft, the PS5 and Xbox Series X respectively. That rate is at the cost of performance, though, as is to be expected from a system that can do both, paying the premium on portability here. If you're someone who primarily plays on the TV in docked mode, you're going to want to stick with the standard Switch, as there are no hardware improvements here to be clear.

With this variant, you're also getting a greatly improved kickstand and significantly better speakers as well, so playing handheld or tabletop will be the way to go here. Simply put, the best Nintendo Switch games are going to look as good as they possibly can with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. It's not quite the Nintendo Switch Pro people continue to ask for, but for what it is, there's no better Nintendo console to rival it right now.

No matter which Nintendo Switch model you're planning on buying, if any, you may be interested in what the handheld hybrid's controller options are. Be sure to give our best Nintendo Switch controllers guide a browse if you're curious about taking your Switch games to the next level.

Even more than five years after its initial launch period, the Nintendo Switch continues to win over the hearts and minds of gamers from all generations. With that at first could be arguably deemed a gimmick, the ability to play Nintendo Switch games not only on the TV but also on the go, was a big deal. Well, it may lack that star power it once did way back when, but there are still a ton of Nintendo Switch games to indulge in, with excellent first-party exclusives and tremendous third-party support that cannot be denied.

The hybrid console is an undeniable success Nintendo Switch review

While the OLED version has the best features for upgraded handheld play, the original 2017 model certainly doesn't disappoint in the visual department either. More than half a decade on, it's impressive to see what developers have been able to pump out of the small handheld as it goes into its sixth year of market availability. Some recent standouts include the stellar Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and the awesome Bayonetta 3 just to name a few.

The truth of the matter is that the Nintendo Switch hardware is starting to show its age nowadays, though. However, you're not buying the handheld-home console hybrid for its visual prowess of blisteringly quick performance, but for the wealth of exclusive games that you cannot find anywhere else. If you're okay with 1080p resolution when docked and 720p on the go, preferring gameplay to fidelity, then there's a lot to admire about this machine.

Nintendo Switch Lite (Image credit: TechRadar)

The biggest strength that the Nintendo Switch Lite has over the other models in the lineup is the price point and the form factor. While this model doesn't 'Switch' as it were, you're limited to purely handheld play, this model is a little smaller and sleeker than the original and OLED SKUs, so it's more backpack ready.

With its relatively affordable asking price of $199.99 / £200 depending on the colorway, the Nintendo Switch Lite is considerably cheaper than its siblings. You're saving roughly $100 / £60 by forgoing the ability to dock to the TV. Because this a dedicated handheld, that means that you aren't as restricted to the different variants and designs either, as there's a full range of bright and expressive options to choose from including blue, pink, purple, grey, and yellow just to list a few.

The Nintendo Switch Lite is a great, compact device for those who aren't a fan of (or simply never use) the original Switch's docked mode Nintendo Switch Lite review

There's also the ergonomics of the Nintendo Switch Lite to factor into why it's ideal for younger kids as well. There are no Joy-Cons to lose as with both the standard and OLED models. Instead, the controls are built right into the side. We found in our testing that this version was actually better for those with smaller hands and was more comfortable for longer periods of time. You're getting a slightly smaller screen here, sure, but the same sharp 720p resolution, so there's no performance or visual downgrade here.

7. Steam Deck The best handheld console for PC gamers Our expert review: Specifications CPU: Zen 2 4c/8t, 2.4-3.5GHz (up to 448 GFlops FP32) GPU: 8 RDNA 2 CUs, 1.0-1.6GHz (up to 1.6 TFlops FP32) RAM : 16 GB LPDDR5 Resolution : 7-inch 1280 x 800px Refresh rate: 60 Hz Internal storage: 64GB eMMC; 256GB NVMe; 512GB NVMe SSD Expandable storage: MicroSD card compatible Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Amazon View at Newegg Reasons to buy + Good performance + Huge library of games + Excellent construction Reasons to avoid - Slow load times - Short battery life

Have you ever wanted to get into PC gaming but were put off by the price point or form factor? Well, that's where the Steam Deck comes in to change up the game forever. It's been available for just shy of a year now, and in that short span of time, the handheld console / PC has won over many who would otherwise be confined to a gaming desk and gaming chair.

With its surprisingly humble starting asking price of $399 / £349 for the most basic model and up to $649 / £569 for the highest-end version, the Steam Deck packs in a hell of a lot of high-end hardware for those rates. It's available only directly through Valve's Steam client at the time of writing. Regardless of the version you opt for, you'll be able to experience many officially Verified titles including Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Days Gone, and Stray just at the tip of the iceberg. The list is growing all the time, too, so there's still plenty more to come yet.

The Steam Deck is a brilliant gaming device that should appeal to PC gamers looking for a way to play their games while on the go Steam Deck review

That's what's so continually impressive about the Steam Deck as it harkens back to the wow factor we first saw with the Nintendo Switch over half a decade ago; true console-quality gaming on the go. Valve's first foray into the handheld hardware market isn't entirely perfect, as the battery life isn't amazing, but given just how good so many demanding titles look and run on this device, it's a trade-off we'll gladly accept.

Not every game from your Steam library will run flawlessly on this device, but there's a good chance that a sizeable chunk of titles you already own will be compatible straight out of the box. What does that mean for you? Well, if you're someone who has been gaming on PC for a decent length of time, there will be many of the best PC games to play in either handheld or docked modes. That's right, you can connect the Steam Deck up to its own dock and use it as a full-fledged PC as well.

Best Gaming Console - FAQs

Is the PS5 or Xbox Series X cheaper? The PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X have an average selling price of $499 to $500, meaning there is hardly anything between their average cost, but on average the Xbox Series X comes in slightly cheaper.

It’s a first (ever) for the brand as it ventures outside to give customers the opportunity to cook their favorite foods in a not-so-dissimilar manner that they're used to.

It's an outdoor cooking appliance that I think is most definitely tipped to be the best air fryer for outdoors, since air frying is just one of its seven settings that it's capable of achieving under the hood. It doesn't take up much more room (if any) than your fave counter-top appliance either so it's one that even the smallest yards can make room for.

During my time with the Ninja Woodfire I tucked into cuisines from Italy, America and Australia, indulging in smoked tear-and-share garlic bread, grilled corn-on-the-cob, and air fried courgette and sweetcorn fritters (my favorite).

These three settings (smoke, grill, and air fry) were the only settings being shown to us, yet the electric BBQ grill and smoker can also roast, bake, reheat and dehydrate. Depending on the foods you're cooking, you can opt for the most suitable setting by turning the dial on the control panel.

I caught up with the Ninja Woodfire brand ambassador, Gino D'Acampo, who spoke highly about it and shared with me that he has tried all but one of the settings…

If you like cooking, you can’t go wrong Gino D'Acampo, Brand Ambassador

Gino's blind spot is the Dehydrate setting, but he mentioned that he's going to be trying it this weekend on a piece of smoked salmon, so I'll keep a look out for his verdict, but what he did rave about is a smoked boiled egg – the jury's out on this one for me.

The control panel, which is located at the front of the product, also houses the timer and temperature settings plus the smoke fire button, which can change the taste sensation of the foods on 'smoke'. Pellets can be added to a pull-out type drawer to the side of the hood. These pellets burn cleanly and leave very little ash to tidy.

Ninja sells two types of these pellets: Robust Blend and All-Purpose Blend. The Robust is a mix of Hickory, Cherry, Maple and Oak to recreate that rich, classic BBQ flavour, and the All-Purpose is a concoction of Cherry, Maple and Oak for a balanced, mild and sweet flavour. They're available to buy from the Ninja website, along with a ton of other accessories such as a grill pellet scoop, grill plate, and stand.

The Ninja Woodfire can be left outdoors all year round, the company says, but if you want to give it that little bit extra protection, there is a cover that you can buy from the Ninja US and Ninja UK site, which I think would be well worth getting for $20 / £29.99.

What you do get for the $369.60 / £349.99 price of the Ninja Woodfire, is the machine, a pellet starter pack (both blends), pellet scoop, crisper basket, and chef-created recipe guide to help you get cooking.

Our US readers could also benefit from the Ninja Woodfire Pro Outdoor Grill with Built-in Thermometer and Premium Package for $459.60 which has the grill cover, veggie tray and roasting trays included, or you can get it in a deep red hue for no extra cost.

Let’s hope a form of Vanta Black or a similarly effective reflection-limiting tech hits the best TVs on the market en masse soon.","Look at the difference in the reflection's impact on these two Philips TVs – the left is what we want to see on more TVs.

Reflections suck. Unless you happen to be Timothée Chalamet, they’re not want to you want to see from your TV instead of the actual picture. Even if you own one of the brightest and best 4K TVs , if you’re watching content in a sun-filled room, reflections can absolutely kill the viewing experience.

That goes double if your TV's brightness isn't very high, which tends to be true of mid-range or cheaper sets, as well as many of the best OLED TVs.

Historically, screen makers (especially in PC monitors) have deployed screens with matt finishes when trying to limit reflectivity. While this is an effective technique, it also comes with a major caveat: matt screens limit brightness, and can reduce perceived sharpness. That’s why LG Display’s new ‘Vanta Black’ polarizer could potentially be such a game-changer. We've seen it in person, and not only does it have a huge impact on how much light a TV reflects, it does so without dampening the brightness of the picture. You can see the difference (with a black screen) at the top of this page – look at how the screen being reflected is so much dimmer on the left, and how less invasive the reflection of the spotlights are.

There is a catch with Vanta Black, though. While it’s an undeniably impressive tech – one that wowed us when we saw the impressive Philips OLED+908 – it’s currently only being rolled out in certain high-end TVs.

Back in Black

The Vanta Black polarizer is housed in not only the Philips OLED+908, but also the upcoming Panasonic MZ2000 OLED and the LG G3 OLED . With all three TVs boasting the '3rd Gen OLED Panel' from LG Display that also includes Micro Lens Array (MLA) tech, which is set to dramatically boost picture brightness, these OLEDs are at the cutting edge of television tech in 2023. As such, they’re set to be expensive. Really expensive.

Unless you’re willing to drop north of two grand on a new 55-inch OLED with MLA, you’re not going to experience the reflection-killing magic of Vanta Black anytime soon. That’s a real shame, because the benefits of the polarizer could have a huge impact on the sort of mid-range 4K TVs that most people are actually looking to buy.

Here's Panasonic's depiction of the MLA tech in the MZ2000 TV, also found in the LG G3 and Philips OLED+908. (Image credit: Pansonic)

While Micro Lens Array tech is hugely exciting, limiting reflections can be every bit as impactful to a real-world viewing experience as raising brightness – and it could be much cheaper than building in bleeding-edge pixels. Before the Samsung S95B QD-OLED hit stores last year – turning in a brighter picture than any previous OLED we’d ever tested thanks to its quantum dot filter – traditional OLEDs had long struggled with brightness issues.

As someone who watches movies in a bright room with large patio-style windows, I’m frequently forced to look at my own pale visage being reflected back at me. My LG C2 OLED may be one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, but it could benefit big-time from the Vanta Black polarizer, or something equivalent.

The Samsung-made QD-OLED panels found in the Samsung S95C and Sony A95L also promise lower reflections than the previous version, though we've yet to really assess that.

And that’s talking about some seriously premium panels. Just imagine the impact this kind of tech could have on more affordable screens that can’t come close to the LG C2’s HDR performance. With the addition of something similar to stamp down on reflections, mid-range TVs could look brighter without actually needing to be brighter and, therefore, more expensive.

A time to reflect

Whether limiting screen reflections is achieved via Vanta Black or an alternative polarizer, reducing reflectivity could be transformative for budget-friendly TVs going forward. Combating light pollution is one of the biggest challenges AV enthusiasts have to tackle, and any solution that doesn’t involve blackout blinds is a winner in my book.

With global electricity prices continuing to skyrocket and the European Union placing stricter power consumption regulations on new TVs, manufacturers need to come up with methods of boosting brightness that isn’t dependent on pumping in more energy to make brighter panels (though I should note that the '3rd Gen OLED Panels' are actually more efficient than what's come before).

If LG Display or other manufactures can bring a version of Vanta Black or similar reflection-slaying features to a wide range of mid-range TVs, it could transform the market. The notion of a future generation of affordable screens that severely limit reflections without being blighted by matt finishes is an exciting prospect.

Let’s hope a form of Vanta Black or a similarly effective reflection-limiting tech hits the best TVs on the market en masse soon. I understand why tech like this would be introduced at the top end of the market, but it's not where it's needed the most.

60 seconds review

Noblechairs has carved a niche with its extensive gaming range, but it is also embracing, as a logical next step, the broader world of office chairs with the Legend series. The Legend TX fits neatly in this hybrid world, and overall, for its price, the chair's build and packaging are almost beyond reproach bar a couple of minor annoyances. It would have been nice if they had used a single bolt type and improved upon the provided tool. The top armrests look and feel particularly comfortable and solid, as do the base and wheels. The chair's shape is inspired by luxury car seats, according to the vendor, and it does ooze quality. While everyone’s morphology is different, the Legend TX is a definite improvement on your average office chair.

Pricing and availability

The Legend TX is only available with fabric upholstery, direct from Noblechairs, for £420 in the UK or $639 in the US . The chair is also available in “high-tech faux leather” in four colors (black, white, dark brown, and black./red/white). You will pay roughly 10% more for the upgrade. Note that various retailers sell the chair but more often than not, at a premium price. Noblechair has a wide network of resellers worldwide (including Ukraine and Uzbekistan) to cater to a global audience.

Setup and assembly

The chair is cushioned by ample amounts of foam and a layer of foam or plastic covers everything in the box to prevent scratches from jostling when the chair is shipped. Everything is packed neatly and snugly enough that it isn’t too hard to get things out but also prevent the jostling.

The chair is separated into five key components along with a box containing accessories and the head cushion, lumbar support pillow, some straps, and manual. The accessories box contained the five wheels, piston, piston cover, some covers, and handles. The bolts and screws required were neatly packed in a clear plastic tray along with a hex cum cross-head screwdriver/wrench.

The first part of the assembly is to install the left side armrest, as that isn’t installed at the factory. Not an issue, but the bolts are pre-fitted, requiring that you undo them first, and they have been placed in there incredibly tightly, meaning you had to use a lot of force to undo them.

On that, the provided tool has the crosshead bit on one end. When using the hex end to tighten bolts, the cross head digs into the palm of your hand. After placing the armrest, the next task was assembling the wheelbase. Not too hard; just pop each wheel into the five-spoke base, lay it flat, and fit in the piston and its cover.

You then have to attach the base plate to the bottom of the chair using the same tool and similar bolts to the armrest. I discovered that the provided tool would foul the plate. You could only get half a turn before removing the tool, repositioning it, and turning it again. By this point, I’d given up using the provided tool and brought out a proper set of tools to continue the assembly.

Ideally, blue thread lockers should be placed on those bolts to prevent them from coming out, time will tell how long they will stay in. Afterward it was a matter of popping the seat onto the piston. The next step has a hazard which they do point out, but personally, I think they should seriously emphasize the hazard.

The left side backrest arm is held in place by a red screw for shipping and must be removed, you then pull the backrest handle to put the arm in a vertical position. The speed and snappiness of the arm flying forwards are almost guillotine-like, so be mindful of your fingers on it.

Once the arms are both vertical, it’s a matter of screwing the backrest onto the arms, popping the covers on, screwing them down, and fit the head support pillow

The lumbar cushion is a bit confusing. The manual isn’t clear on how it fits. Just put the cushion at the crease between the seat and the backrest as per the photos.

There are some provided straps that are never mentioned in the manual. I can only assume they are for the lumbar pillow as there are corresponding hook points on the back of the cushion, but how they go on and fit neatly is a mystery

All in all assembly took approximately two people about 30 to 45 minutes to assemble with proper tools. Using only the provided tool, I suspect, would take you an hour or a little bit more. I was left with a spare of each screw which was an excellent addition should any be lost.

In use and comfortability

Once assembled, the chair had an imposing presence. The material was smooth and velvety and appears to be hard-wearing. The headrest was nice and spongy with the right feel and even more velvety feeling and can be adjusted in height as it only straps on over the backrest.

The bolsters on either side of the backrest and seat kept you in place in the middle and provided plenty of cushioning and support. The backrest covers on either side are ok, but the plastic covers on the sides of the seat feel flimsy, especially on the right-hand side, where some mechanical parts feel more exposed than they should.

The armrests can move in four directions for adjustability. Armrests are made of faux rubber-like plastic, giving them a nice cushion-like feel, but aesthetically, they look cheap. The chair can go as high as 58cm and as low as 48cm

The backrest has a lay back as far as 125 degrees to bolt upright. All movements in the seat do feel smooth and actuate and move.

The wheels roll nicely on faux wooden flooring as per the pictures, but the plastic look makes them look cheap. Ideally, they should have come with a rubber part on the wheel to provide the wheels some bounce and prevent marking floors in the long run.

The chair spoke base is made of a matt black metal with angular features which aesthetically does detract from the more rounded edges of the armrests, which also have a nice black nickel look. It would have been nice if the spoke base followed this design as the chair looks expensive up top, but below looks like a basic office chair, although there’s nothing with it. In other places on the chair, there are little highlights, such as the branding of Noble, which add a nice touch.

Should I buy the Noblechairs Legend TX

Buy if...

You’re looking for a great sitting experience.

The Legend TX is all you’ve ever wanted from a top-of-the-range office chair (except that it doesn’t come with any snazzy gadgets).

Don’t buy if...

You’re on a budget.

At more than £400/$600, it costs more than your average standing desk and there’s a lot of more affordable options out there.

This news was shared on Twitter by Mikhail Parakhin, head of Microsoft’s Advertising and Web Services division, as spotted by MS Power User.

Now almost everyone - 90% - should be seeing the Bing Chat Mode selector (the tri-toggle). I definitely prefer Creative, but Precise is also interesting - it's much more factual. See which one you like. The 10% who are still in the control group should start seeing it today.March 1, 2023 See more

As you can see, at the time of the tweet, 90% of Bing chatbot users had the tri-toggle chat selector that lets you switch between three different personalities for the AI (Precise, Balanced, or Creative).

The remaining control group (10%) then had the selector rolled out to them across the course of yesterday, so everyone should have it by now. That’s good news for those who want more options when it comes to the chatbot’s responses to their queries.

Earlier this week, we saw other work on the AI to reduce what are called ‘hallucinations’ (where the chatbot gives inaccurate info, or plain makes a mistake). There was also tinkering to ensure that instances where Bing simply fails to respond to a query happen less often.

While that’s all good, it seems on the latter count, there’s a fresh stumbling block that has been introduced with the latest version of the chatbot which has the personality selector – namely a ‘something went wrong’ error message when querying the ChatGPT-powered AI.

In the above Twitter thread, there are a few complaints along these lines, so hopefully this is something Microsoft is already investigating.

Analysis: Creative for the win? Maybe for now...

Doubtless there will be plenty of experimentation with the chat modes to determine exactly how these three personalities are different.

Thus far, the ‘Creative’ setting seems to be getting the most positive feedback, and this is likely the one many Bing users are plumping for. Simply because this is where the AI has the most free rein, and so will seem more human-like – rather than ‘Precise’ mode which is more like a straight answer to a search query. (Arguably somewhat defeating the point of having an AI carrying out your searches, anyway).

‘Balanced’ is a middle road between the two, so that may tempt fans of compromise, naturally.

Initial feedback indicates that in Creative mode Bing gives more detailed answers, not just adding a more personal touch, but seemingly fleshing out replies to a greater depth. That’s going to be useful, and likely to lead to this being the more popular choice. Especially as this setting is where you’re going to get the more interesting – or perhaps occasionally eccentric, or even outlandish – responses.

Microsoft may need to look at working on the Balanced setting to be a more compelling choice, particularly if it sees that traffic is heavily skewed towards the Creative option.

That said, the latter being popular is likely to be partly tied in with how new the AI is, attracting people who are curious and just want to mess around with the chatbot to see what they can get Bing to say. Those kind of users will doubtless get bored of toying with the AI before too long, giving a different picture of personality usage when the dust settles a bit more.

At any rate, tweaking Bing’s personalities is something that’ll doubtless happen on an ongoing basis, and we may even get more options aside from these initial three eventually. Come on, Microsoft, we all want to see ‘Angry’ Bing in action, or maybe a ‘Disillusioned’ chatbot (or how about an ‘Apocalypse Survivor’ setting?).
