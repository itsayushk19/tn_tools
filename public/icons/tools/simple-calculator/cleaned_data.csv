Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, other, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance.

Snowflake Summit—Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the Data Cloud Company, and NVIDIA today announced at Snowflake Summit 2023 that they are partnering to provide businesses of all sizes with an accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud.

With the NVIDIA NeMo™ platform for developing large language models (LLMs) and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated computing, Snowflake will enable enterprises to use data in their Snowflake accounts to make custom LLMs for advanced generative AI services, including chatbots, search and summarization. The ability to customize LLMs without moving data enables proprietary information to remain fully secured and governed within the Snowflake platform.

“Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA will bring high-performance machine learning and artificial intelligence to our vast volumes of proprietary and structured enterprise data, a new frontier to bringing unprecedented insights, predictions and prescriptions to the global world of business,” said Frank Slootman, chairman and CEO of Snowflake.

“Data is essential to creating generative AI applications that understand the complex operations and unique voice of every company,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together, NVIDIA and Snowflake will create an AI factory that helps enterprises turn their own valuable data into custom generative AI models to power groundbreaking new applications — right from the cloud platform that they use to run their businesses.”

NVIDIA and Snowflake’s collaboration represents a new opportunity for enterprises. It will enable them to use their proprietary data — which can range from hundreds of terabytes to petabytes of raw and curated business information — to create and fine-tune custom LLMs that power business-specific applications and services.

By integrating AI technology from Snowflake and NVIDIA, customers can quickly and easily build, deploy and manage customized applications that bring the power of generative AI to all parts of their business across a variety of use cases. In addition, expanding AI capabilities in the Data Cloud enables these customers to create generative AI applications where their governed data already resides, a benefit that significantly reduces cost and latency while maintaining the security of their data.

“More enterprises than we expected are training or at least fine-tuning their own AI models, as they increasingly appreciate the value of their own data assets,” said Alexander Harrowell, principal analyst for advanced computing for AI at technology research group Omdia. “Similarly, enterprises are beginning to operate more diverse fleets of AI models for business-specific applications. Supporting them in this trend is one of the biggest open opportunities in the sector.”

Custom Models for Healthcare, Retail, Financial Services and More

With over 8,000 customers worldwide (as of April 30, 2023), the Snowflake Data Cloud gives enterprises the ability to unify, integrate, analyze and share data across their organizations, as well as with customers, partners, suppliers and others. In addition, customers can build and share leading data applications at scale with the Data Cloud.

Snowflake’s unified platform offers industry-specific Data Clouds to help deliver innovative solutions across multiple verticals and lines of business spanning advertising, media and entertainment, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, retail and consumer-packaged goods, technology and telecom. Most recently, Snowflake launched the Government and Education Data Cloud to enable data-driven decision making for the public sector.

Snowflake and NVIDIA’s collaboration will further enable customers to transform these industries by bringing customized generative AI applications to different verticals with the Data Cloud. For example, a healthcare insurance model could answer complex questions about procedures that are covered under various plans. A financial services model could share details about specific lending opportunities available to retail and business customers based on specific circumstances.

NVIDIA NeMo is a cloud-native enterprise platform for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models with billions of parameters. Snowflake plans to host and run NeMo in the Data Cloud, enabling customers to build, customize and deploy custom LLMs used for generative AI applications, such as chatbots and intelligent search.

With NeMo Guardrails software, developers can ensure their applications are aligned with business-specific topics, safety and security requirements.

ISC—NVIDIA, Rolls-Royce and Classiq, a quantum software company, today announced a quantum computing breakthrough aimed at bringing ever-increasing efficiency to jet engines.

Using NVIDIA’s quantum computing platform, the companies have designed and simulated the world’s largest quantum computing circuit for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) — a circuit that measures 10 million layers deep with 39 qubits. By using GPUs, Rolls-Royce is preparing for a quantum future despite the limitations of today’s quantum computers, which only support circuits a few layers deep.

Rolls-Royce plans to use the new circuit on its journey to quantum advantage in CFD for modeling the performance of jet engine designs in simulations that use both classical and quantum computing methods.

Such breakthroughs are important to Rolls-Royce, a world leader in the aviation industry, in its work to build state-of-the-art jet engines that support the energy transition with more sustainable aviation.

“Designing jet engines, which are one of the most complicated devices on earth, is expensive and computationally challenging,” said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA’s quantum computing platform gives Rolls-Royce a potential path to tackle these problems head-on while accelerating its research and future development of more efficient jet engines.”

“Applying both classical and quantum computing methods directly to the challenge of designing jet engines will help us accelerate our processes and perform more sophisticated calculations,” said Leigh Lapworth, computational science fellow at Rolls-Royce.

Rolls-Royce and its partner, Israel-based Classiq, designed the circuit using Classiq’s synthesis engine and then simulated it using NVIDIA® A100 Tensor Core GPUs . The speed and scale of the process was made possible by NVIDIA cuQuantum , a software development kit that includes optimized libraries and tools to speed up quantum computing workflows.

NVIDIA Grace Hopper Accelerates Quantum Computing

NVIDIA offers a unified computing platform for speeding breakthroughs in quantum research and development across disciplines. The NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines the groundbreaking performance of NVIDIA Hopper™ architecture GPUs with the versatility of the NVIDIA Grace CPUs , is ideally designed for giant-scale quantum simulation workloads.

Additionally, its high-speed, low-latency NVIDIA NVLink®-C2C interconnect makes classical systems built with the superchip optimally suited to link to quantum processors, or QPUs . With a total 600GB of fast-accessible memory per node, Grace Hopper enables the quantum ecosystem to push these simulations to an even larger scale.

A strategic bridge to the quantum future, Grace Hopper powers DGX™ Quantum , the world’s first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system combining quantum computing with state-of-the-art classical computing. NVIDIA also provides developers with NVIDIA CUDA® Quantum , a robust open-source programming model that links GPUs and QPUs.

NVIDIA’s Quantum Ecosystem Expands

A vast array of the world’s quantum computing research now runs on NVIDIA GPUs.

The Jülich Supercomputer Centre, one of Europe’s largest facilities for quantum computing, also announced at ISC plans to build a quantum computing lab with NVIDIA , highlighting the growing importance of hybrid quantum-classical computing systems. The lab will also help developers advance the field of quantum computing with tools like CUDA Quantum.

Additionally, ORCA Computing is the latest QPU builder to integrate CUDA Quantum, combining its photonic quantum computer with GPUs for machine learning. TensorFlow Quantum and TorchQuantum — two popular quantum machine learning frameworks — now also integrate cuQuantum. The majority of the world’s quantum computing software today supports GPU acceleration with the NVIDIA quantum platform.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646b0723b3aed32797f6f05a_Rolls-Royce%20Derby%20Civil%20Aerospace%20Trent%20XWB/Rolls-Royce%20Derby%20Civil%20Aerospace%20Trent%20XWB_2ea1df2f-aa03-4aee-8f0a-7be523ea802a-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646b0723b3aed32797f6f05a_Rolls-Royce%20Derby%20Civil%20Aerospace%20Trent%20XWB/Rolls-Royce%20Derby%20Civil%20Aerospace%20Trent%20XWB_2ea1df2f-aa03-4aee-8f0a-7be523ea802a-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646b0723b3aed32797f6f05a_Rolls-Royce+Derby+Civil+Aerospace+Trent+XWB/Rolls-Royce+Derby+Civil+Aerospace+Trent+XWB_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646b0723b3aed32797f6f05a_Rolls-Royce+Derby+Civil+Aerospace+Trent+XWB/Rolls-Royce+Derby+Civil+Aerospace+Trent+XWB_s.jpg'}"

NVIDIA today announced the GeForce RTX™ 4070 GPU, delivering all the advancements of the NVIDIA® Ada Lovelace architecture — including DLSS 3 neural rendering, real-time ray-tracing technologies and the ability to run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution — starting at $599.

Today’s PC gamers increasingly want super-premium visual experiences, with 83% of GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop gamers enabling ray tracing and 79% turning on DLSS, a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance, now in its third generation.

“Making sure games are ‘RTX ON’ with both ray tracing and DLSS has become a top priority for the majority of PC gamers,” said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “With prices starting at $599, the RTX 4070 is an amazing upgrade for gamers running on previous-generation GPUs.”

Play at 100+ FPS at 1440p With DLSS 3

The RTX 4070 allows the latest games such as A Plague Tale: Requiem, Dying Light 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and other demanding titles to run at over 100 frames per second, thanks to DLSS 3, as well as popular games such as Battlefield 2042, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy that support DLSS 2.

With DLSS 3, AI-powered frame generation creates new, high-quality frames for smoother gameplay, rendering seven out of every eight pixels in a scene. Exceptional responsiveness is maintained through NVIDIA Reflex , which reduces input lag between devices and monitors.

Ray-tracing performance has also significantly improved, thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering (SER), cutting-edge Opacity Micromap, and Displaced Micro-Mesh Engines. These innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion.

This potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. Adoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available, with adoption of DLSS 3 happening 7x faster than its predecessor.

Class-Leading Performance and Features

Compared to the RTX 2070 SUPER, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3, and on average 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.

DLSS 3 provides Ada Lovelace GPUs with a tremendous performance boost, but the GeForce RTX 4070 also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS.

In these rasterized games, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on par with the GeForce RTX 3080 while running at nearly half the power — and offering an additional 2GB of memory. Additionally, the RTX 4070’s memory subsystem has been enhanced with 36MB of L2 cache and 12GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.

Perfect for Content Creators

The GeForce RTX 4070 GPU comes backed by the NVIDIA Studio platform , which enables content creators to work faster and smarter with RTX acceleration and AI tools. Serving creators from livestreamers to video editors, the platform supercharges 100 creative apps, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers and includes a powerful suite of Studio apps, such as NVIDIA Omniverse ™, Canvas and Broadcast .

3D modelers rendering 4K scenes with the AI-powered DLSS 3 in NVIDIA Omniverse — a hub to interconnect existing 3D workflows, replacing linear pipelines with live-sync creation for real-time collaboration — can expect 2.8x faster performance than with last generation’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.

Broadcasters deploying the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder NVENC, with support for AV1, will enjoy 40% better efficiency. Livestreams will appear as if bitrate was increased by 40% — a big boost in image quality for popular broadcast apps like OBS Studio. AV1 is already supported in Discord with a full release coming to YouTube via OBS Studio soon.

Video editors will see 20% faster video export speeds, thanks to the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder on the GeForce RTX 4070, along with AV1 incorporated into top video editing apps.

And all creators can benefit from the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI tools, providing a significant performance increase from the last generation.

GTC—Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced a multi-part collaboration focused on building out the world's most scalable, on-demand artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure optimized for training increasingly complex large language models (LLMs) and developing generative AI applications.

The joint work features next-generation Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and AWS’s state-of-the-art networking and scalability that will deliver up to 20 exaFLOPS of compute performance for building and training the largest deep learning models. P5 instances will be the first GPU-based instance to take advantage of AWS’s second-generation Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking, which provides 3,200 Gbps of low-latency, high bandwidth networking throughput, enabling customers to scale up to 20,000 H100 GPUs in EC2 UltraClusters for on-demand access to supercomputer-class performance for AI.

“AWS and NVIDIA have collaborated for more than 12 years to deliver large-scale, cost-effective GPU-based solutions on demand for various applications such as AI/ML, graphics, gaming, and HPC,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. “AWS has unmatched experience delivering GPU-based instances that have pushed the scalability envelope with each successive generation, with many customers scaling machine learning training workloads to more than 10,000 GPUs today. With second-generation EFA, customers will be able to scale their P5 instances to over 20,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, bringing supercomputer capabilities on demand to customers ranging from startups to large enterprises.”

“Accelerated computing and AI have arrived, and just in time. Accelerated computing provides step-function speed-ups while driving down cost and power as enterprises strive to do more with less. Generative AI has awakened companies to reimagine their products and business models and to be the disruptor and not the disrupted,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AWS is a long-time partner and was the first cloud service provider to offer NVIDIA GPUs. We are thrilled to combine our expertise, scale, and reach to help customers harness accelerated computing and generative AI to engage the enormous opportunities ahead.”

New Supercomputing Clusters

New P5 instances are built on more than a decade of collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA delivering the AI and HPC infrastructure and build on four previous collaborations across P2, P3, P3dn, and P4d(e) instances. P5 instances are the fifth generation of AWS offerings powered by NVIDIA GPUs and come almost 13 years after its initial deployment of NVIDIA GPUs, beginning with CG1 instances.

P5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models behind the most-demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, and more.

Specifically built for both enterprises and startups racing to bring AI-fueled innovation to market in a scalable and secure way, P5 instances feature eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs capable of 16 petaFLOPs of mixed-precision performance, 640 GB of high-bandwidth memory, and 3,200 Gbps networking connectivity (8x more than the previous generation) in a single EC2 instance. The increased performance of P5 instances accelerates the time-to-train machine learning (ML) models by up to 6x (reducing training time from days to hours), and the additional GPU memory helps customers train larger, more complex models. P5 instances are expected to lower the cost to train ML models by up to 40% over the previous generation, providing customers greater efficiency over less flexible cloud offerings or expensive on-premises systems.

Amazon EC2 P5 instances are deployed in hyperscale clusters called EC2 UltraClusters that are comprised of the highest performance compute, networking, and storage in the cloud. Each EC2 UltraCluster is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, enabling customers to run their most complex multi-node ML training and distributed HPC workloads. They feature petabit-scale non-blocking networking, powered by AWS EFA, a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS. EFA’s custom-built operating system (OS) bypass hardware interface and integration with NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA enhances the performance of inter-instance communications by lowering latency and increasing bandwidth utilization, which is critical to scaling training of deep learning models across hundreds of P5 nodes. With P5 instances and EFA, ML applications can use NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) to scale up to 20,000 H100 GPUs. As a result, customers get the application performance of on-premises HPC clusters with the on-demand elasticity and flexibility of AWS. On top of these cutting-edge computing capabilities, customers can use the industry’s broadest and deepest portfolio of services such as Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon FSx for high-performance file systems, and Amazon SageMaker for building, training, and deploying deep learning applications. P5 instances will be available in the coming weeks in limited preview. To request access, visit https://pages.awscloud.com/EC2-P5-Interest.html.

With the new EC2 P5 instances, customers like Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, Pinterest, and Stability AI will be able to build and train the largest ML models at scale. The collaboration through additional generations of EC2 instances will help startups, enterprises, and researchers seamlessly scale to meet their ML needs.

Anthropic builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems that will have many opportunities to create value commercially and for public benefit. “At Anthropic, we are working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. While the large, general AI systems of today can have significant benefits, they can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque. Our goal is to make progress on these issues and deploy systems that people find useful,” said Tom Brown, co-founder of Anthropic. “Our organization is one of the few in the world that is building foundational models in deep learning research. These models are highly complex, and to develop and train these cutting-edge models, we need to distribute them efficiently across large clusters of GPUs. We are using Amazon EC2 P4 instances extensively today, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of P5 instances. We expect them to deliver substantial price-performance benefits over P4d instances, and they’ll be available at the massive scale required for building next-generation large language models and related products.”

Cohere, a leading pioneer in language AI, empowers every developer and enterprise to build incredible products with world-leading natural language processing (NLP) technology while keeping their data private and secure. “Cohere leads the charge in helping every enterprise harness the power of language AI to explore, generate, search for, and act upon information in a natural and intuitive manner, deploying across multiple cloud platforms in the data environment that works best for each customer,” said Aidan Gomez, CEO at Cohere. “NVIDIA H100-powered Amazon EC2 P5 instances will unleash the ability of businesses to create, grow, and scale faster with its computing power combined with Cohere’s state-of-the-art LLM and generative AI capabilities.”

Hugging Face is on a mission to democratize good machine learning. “As the fastest growing open source community for machine learning, we now provide over 150,000 pre-trained models and 25,000 datasets on our platform for NLP, computer vision, biology, reinforcement learning, and more,” said Julien Chaumond, CTO and co-founder at Hugging Face. “With significant advances in large language models and generative AI, we’re working with AWS to build and contribute the open source models of tomorrow. We’re looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker at scale in UltraClusters with EFA to accelerate the delivery of new foundation AI models for everyone.”

Today, more than 450 million people around the world use Pinterest as a visual inspiration platform to shop for products personalized to their taste, find ideas to do offline, and discover the most inspiring creators. “We use deep learning extensively across our platform for use-cases such as labeling and categorizing billions of photos that are uploaded to our platform, and visual search that provides our users the ability to go from inspiration to action,"" said David Chaiken, Chief Architect at Pinterest. ""We have built and deployed these use-cases by leveraging AWS GPU instances such as P3 and the latest P4d instances. We are looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances featuring H100 GPUs, EFA and Ultraclusters to accelerate our product development and bring new Empathetic AI-based experiences to our customers.”

As the leader in multimodal, open-source AI model development and deployment, Stability AI collaborates with public- and private-sector partners to bring this next-generation infrastructure to a global audience. “At Stability AI, our goal is to maximize the accessibility of modern AI to inspire global creativity and innovation,” said Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI. “We initially partnered with AWS in 2021 to build Stable Diffusion, a latent text-to-image diffusion model, using Amazon EC2 P4d instances that we employed at scale to accelerate model training time from months to weeks. As we work on our next generation of open-source generative AI models and expand into new modalities, we are excited to use Amazon EC2 P5 instances in second-generation EC2 UltraClusters. We expect P5 instances will further improve our model training time by up to 4x, enabling us to deliver breakthrough AI more quickly and at a lower cost.”

New Server Designs for Scalable, Efficient AI

Leading up to the release of H100, NVIDIA and AWS engineering teams with expertise in thermal, electrical, and mechanical fields have collaborated to design servers to harness GPUs to deliver AI at scale, with a focus on energy efficiency in AWS infrastructure.

GTC—NVIDIA today announced a breakthrough that brings accelerated computing to the field of computational lithography, enabling semiconductor leaders like ASML, TSMC and Synopsys to accelerate the design and manufacturing of next-generation chips, just as current production processes are nearing the limits of what physics makes possible.

The new NVIDIA cuLitho software library for computational lithography is being integrated by TSMC, the world’s leading foundry, as well as electronic design automation leader Synopsys into their software, manufacturing processes and systems for the latest-generation NVIDIA Hopper™ architecture GPUs. Equipment maker ASML is working closely with NVIDIA on GPUs and cuLitho, and is planning to integrate support for GPUs into all of its computational lithography software products.

The advance will enable chips with tinier transistors and wires than is now achievable, while accelerating time to market and boosting energy efficiency of the massive data centers that run 24/7 to drive the manufacturing process.

“The chip industry is the foundation of nearly every other industry in the world,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With lithography at the limits of physics, NVIDIA’s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond.”

Running on GPUs, cuLitho delivers a performance leap of up to 40x beyond current lithography — the process of creating patterns on a silicon wafer — accelerating the massive computational workloads that currently consume tens of billions of CPU hours every year.

It enables 500 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems to achieve the work of 40,000 CPU systems, running all parts of the computational lithography process in parallel, helping reduce power needs and potential environmental impact.

In the near term, fabs using cuLitho could help produce each day 3-5x more photomasks — the templates for a chip’s design — using 9x less power than current configurations. A photomask that required two weeks can now be processed overnight.

Longer term, cuLitho will enable better design rules, higher density, higher yields and AI-powered lithography.

Support From Industry Leaders

NVIDIA is working with key partners to smooth the speedy adoption of these new technologies.

“The cuLitho team has made admirable progress on speeding up computational lithography by moving expensive operations to GPU,” said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC. “This development opens up new possibilities for TSMC to deploy lithography solutions like inverse lithography technology and deep learning more broadly in chip manufacturing, making important contributions to the continuation of semiconductor scaling.”​

“We are planning to integrate support for GPUs into all of our computational lithography software products,” said Peter Wennink, CEO of ASML. “Our collaboration with NVIDIA on GPUs and cuLitho should result in tremendous benefit to computational lithography, and therefore to semiconductor scaling. This will be especially true in the era of high NA extreme ultraviolet lithography.”​

“Computational lithography, specifically optical proximity correction, or OPC, is pushing the boundaries of compute workloads for the most advanced chips,” said Aart de Geus, chair and CEO of Synopsys. “By collaborating with our partner NVIDIA to run Synopsys OPC software on the cuLitho platform, we massively accelerated the performance from weeks to days! The team-up of our two leading companies continues to force amazing advances in the industry.”

Enabling Semiconductor Scaling

The cost of the computational time needed for the largest workloads in semi manufacturing has in recent years been outpacing Moore’s law, due to both the larger number of transistors in newer nodes and more stringent accuracy requirements. Future nodes require more detailed calculations, not all of which can feasibly fit into the available computational bandwidth provided by the current platforms, slowing the pace of innovation in semiconductors.

A fab process change often requires an OPC revision, creating bottlenecks. cuLitho helps remove these bottlenecks, and it makes possible novel solutions and innovative techniques like curvilinear masks, high NA EUV lithography, and sub-atomic photoresist modeling needed for new technology nodes.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/202303212138/641909b7b3aed36687282099_nvidia-culitho/nvidia-culitho_bce086b9-2e24-4ac6-b309-74b6bb63f2c0-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/202303212138/641909b7b3aed36687282099_nvidia-culitho/nvidia-culitho_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/202303212138/641909b7b3aed36687282099_nvidia-culitho/nvidia-culitho_bce086b9-2e24-4ac6-b309-74b6bb63f2c0-prv.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/202303212138/641909b7b3aed36687282099_nvidia-culitho/nvidia-culitho_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDM2NTliNTctOTk5ZC00YjIxLTkzMzYtMWU1ZDU0NWM3MzRhLTEwMTg0ODU=/tiny/NVIDIA-CORPORATION.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

GTC—AT&T Corp. and NVIDIA today announced a collaboration in which AT&T will continue to transform its operations and enhance sustainability by using NVIDIA-powered AI for processing data, optimizing service-fleet routing and building digital avatars for employee support and training.

AT&T is the first telecommunications provider to explore the use of a full suite of NVIDIA AI offerings. This includes enhancing its data processing using the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which includes the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark; enabling real-time vehicle routing and optimization with NVIDIA cuOpt ; adopting digital avatars with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and NVIDIA Tokkio; and utilizing conversational AI with NVIDIA Riva.

“We strive each day to deliver the most efficient global network, as we drive towards net zero emissions in our operations,” said Andy Markus, chief data officer at AT&T. “Working with NVIDIA to drive AI solutions across our business will help enhance experiences for both our employees and customers.”

“Industries are embracing a new era in which chatbots, recommendation engines and accelerated libraries for data optimization help produce AI-driven innovations,” said Manuvir Das, vice president of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. “Our work with AT&T will help the company better mine its data to drive new services and solutions for the AI-powered telco.”

The Data Dilemma

AT&T, which has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2035, has instituted broad initiatives to make its operations more efficient. A major challenge is optimizing energy consumption while providing network infrastructure that delivers data at high speeds.

AT&T processes more than 590 petabytes of data on average a day. That is the equivalent of about 6.5 million 4K movies or more than 8x the content housed in the U.S. Library of Congress if all its collections were digitized.

Telecoms aiming to reduce energy consumption face challenges across their operations. Within networks, the radio access network (RAN) consumes 73% of energy, while core network services, data centers and operations use 13%, 9% and 5%, respectively, according to the GSMA , a mobile industry trade group.

AT&T first adopted NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark to capitalize on energy-efficient GPUs across its AI and data science pipelines. This helped boost its operational efficiency across everything from training AI models and maintaining network quality and optimization, to reducing customer churn and improving fraud detection.

Of the data and AI pipelines targeted with Spark-RAPIDS, AT&T saves about half of its cloud computing spend and sees faster performance, while enabling reductions in its carbon footprint.

Enhanced Field Dispatch Services

AT&T, which operates one of the largest field dispatch teams to service its customers, is currently testing NVIDIA cuOpt software to enhance its field dispatch capabilities to handle more complex technician routing and optimization challenges.

Routing requires trillions of computations to factor in a variety of factors, from traffic and weather conditions to customer change of plans or a technician’s skill level, where a complicated job might then require an additional truck roll.

In early trials, cuOpt delivered solutions in 10 seconds, while the same computation on x86 CPUs took 1,000 seconds. The results yielded a 90% reduction in cloud costs and allowed technicians to complete more service calls each day. NVIDIA cuOpt allows AT&T to run nearly continuous dispatch optimization software by combining NVIDIA RAPIDS with local search heuristics algorithms and metaheuristics such as Tabu search.

Pleasing Customers, Speeding Network Design

As part of its efforts to improve productivity for its more than 150,000 employees, AT&T is moving to adopt NVIDIA Omniverse ACE and NVIDIA Tokkio, cloud-native AI microservices, workflows and application frameworks for developers to easily build, customize and deploy interactive avatars that see, perceive, intelligently converse and provide recommendations to enhance the customer service experience.

GTC—NVIDIA today announced a new system built with Quantum Machines that provides a revolutionary new architecture for researchers working in high-performance and low-latency quantum-classical computing.

The world’s first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system, the NVIDIA DGX Quantum brings together the world’s most powerful accelerated computing platform — enabled by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip and CUDA Quantum open-source programming model — with the world’s most advanced quantum control platform, OPX, by Quantum Machines.

The combination allows researchers to build extraordinarily powerful applications that combine quantum computing with state-of-the-art classical computing, enabling calibration, control, quantum error correction and hybrid algorithms.

“Quantum-accelerated supercomputing has the potential to reshape science and industry with capabilities that can serve humanity in enormous ways,” said Tim Costa, director of HPC and quantum at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA DGX Quantum will enable researchers to push the boundaries of quantum-classical computing.”

At its heart, DGX Quantum features a NVIDIA Grace Hopper system connected by PCIe to Quantum Machines OPX+, enabling sub-microsecond latency between GPUs and quantum processing units (QPUs).

“We are heading toward a new age of quantum computing that is more accessible to more researchers than ever,” said Itamar Sivan, co-founder and CEO of Quantum Machines. “Our collaboration with NVIDIA on the DGX Quantum system will enable a new generation of innovators to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges.”

Grace Hopper — which integrates the high-performance NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPU with the company’s new Grace CPU — is supercharged for giant-scale AI and HPC applications. It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data, giving quantum-classical researchers unprecedented power to solve the world’s most-complex problems.

OPX+ is a universal quantum control system, which brings real-time classical compute engines into the heart of the quantum control stack to maximize performance of any QPU and open new possibilities in quantum algorithms.

GTC—NVIDIA today announced an expanded set of generative AI cloud services for customizing AI foundation models to accelerate the creation of new proteins and therapeutics, as well as research in the fields of genomics, chemistry, biology and molecular dynamics.

Part of NVIDIA AI Foundations , the new BioNeMo™ Cloud service offering — for both AI model training and inference — accelerates the most time-consuming and costly stages of drug discovery. It enables researchers to fine-tune generative AI applications on their own proprietary data, and to run AI model inference directly in a web browser or through new cloud application programming interfaces (APIs) that easily integrate into existing applications.

“The transformative power of generative AI holds enormous promise for the life science and pharmaceutical industries,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA’s long collaboration with pioneers in the field has led to the development of BioNeMo Cloud Service, which is already serving as an AI drug discovery laboratory. It provides pretrained models and allows customization of models with proprietary data that serve every stage of the drug-discovery pipeline, helping researchers identify the right target, design molecules and proteins, and predict their interactions in the body to develop the best drug candidate.”

Amgen Among Early Users

Amgen, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, is already using the service to advance its research and development efforts.

“BioNeMo is dramatically accelerating our approach to biologics discovery,” said Peter Grandsard, executive director of Biologics Therapeutic Discovery, Center for Research Acceleration by Digital Innovation at Amgen. “With it, we can pretrain large language models for molecular biology on Amgen’s proprietary data, enabling us to explore and develop therapeutic proteins for the next generation of medicine that will help patients.”

Generative AI Supercharges Drug Discovery Pipeline

BioNeMo Cloud service includes pretrained AI models to help researchers build AI pipelines for drug development. It has been adopted by drug-discovery companies including Evozyne and Insilico Medicine to support data-driven drug design for new therapeutic candidates.

Generative AI models can rapidly identify potential drug molecules — in some cases designing compounds or protein-based therapeutics from scratch. Trained on large-scale datasets of small molecules, proteins, DNA and RNA sequences, these models can predict the 3D structure of a protein and how well a molecule will dock with a target protein.

New Generative AI Models Available With BioNeMo Service Early Access

BioNeMo now has six new optimized, open-source models , in addition to its previously announced MegaMolBART generative chemistry model, ESM1nv protein language model and OpenFold protein structure prediction model. They include:

Pharma Companies, Startups Tap BioNeMo to Optimize AI Workflows

Pharmaceutical companies and drug discovery startups are using BioNeMo today and, in many cases, seeing significant results.

Amgen pretrained and fine-tuned BioNeMo’s ESM model architecture using its own proprietary data on antibodies. It was able to slash the time it takes to train five custom models for molecule screening and optimization from three months to a few weeks on DGX Cloud.

Researchers at Evozyne, a Chicago-based biotechnology company and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, have collaborated with NVIDIA to develop a BioNeMo-based deep learning model called the Protein Transformer Variational AutoEncoder. The generative AI model, fine-tuned on Evozyne’s proprietary protein data, enables the design of synthetic variants with significantly improved performance compared to enzymes found in nature.

Insilico Medicine, a premier member of NVIDIA Inception, is using BioNeMo to accelerate the early drug discovery process, which traditionally takes more than four years and costs around $500 million. Using generative AI from end to end, Insilico was able to identify a preclinical candidate drug in one-third of the time and for one-tenth of the cost. The drug is expected to soon enter phase 2 clinical trials with patients.

Since its launch in 2018, NVIDIA DLSS has driven a neural graphics revolution in PC gaming. Neural graphics intertwines AI and graphics to create an accelerated rendering pipeline that continuously learns and improves. Instead of natively rendering every pixel in a frame, DLSS allows the game to render 1/8th of the pixels then uses AI and GeForce RTX™ Tensor Cores to reconstruct the rest of the pixels, dramatically multiplying frame rates, while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution.

Diablo IV, Forza Horizon 5, Redfall — DLSS 3 is in the Biggest Games and Biggest Franchises

To date, over 270 games and applications use NVIDIA DLSS as an AI-powered performance accelerator. DLSS 3, the latest version of the technology, is available in 28 released games and has been adopted 7x faster than DLSS 2 in the first six months of their respective launches.

Among the highly anticipated games being added to the DLSS roster is Forza Horizon 5, named the best open-world racing game of all time by several media outlets and currently holding the highest rating of any racing game tracked by OpenCritic. Forza Horizon 5, which already supports ray tracing, will update to DLSS 3 on March 28.

Redfall, Bethesda’s highly anticipated, open-world, co-op first-person shooter from Arkane Austin, the award-winning team behind Prey and Dishonored, is launching on May 2 with DLSS 3.

In addition, Diablo IV, the latest installment of the genre-defining Diablo franchise — multiple games of which are considered among the best of all time — will be launching on June 6 with DLSS 3.

“Supporting smooth gameplay in Diablo IV is a priority for Blizzard,” said Michael Bukowski, Diablo IV technical director at Blizzard Entertainment. “We’re excited by the high frame rate of Diablo IV running on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series hardware and DLSS 3.”

Additional PC games announcing support of NVIDIA DLSS at GDC include Deceive Inc., Gripper, Smalland: Survive the Wilds and THE FINALS. View the complete list of 270 games and apps that support DLSS .

DLSS Frame Generation Publicly Available for Developers at GDC

NVIDIA will make DLSS Frame Generation plug-ins publicly available during GDC, allowing even more developers to integrate the framerate boosting technology into their games and applications.

DLSS Frame Generation will be available to access via NVIDIA Streamline , an open-source, cross-vendor framework that simplifies the integration of super-resolution technologies in 3D games and apps.

DLSS technology is always improving through ongoing training on NVIDIA’s AI supercomputer. The public release will incorporate the latest DLSS enhancements made earlier this year, including:

DLSS Frame Generation takes better advantage of game engine data, improving user interface stability and image quality during fast movement.

DLSS Super Resolution improves Ultra Performance mode, with finer detail stability and overall better image quality.

DLAA improves image quality, reduces ghosting and improves edge smoothness in high-contrast scenarios.

Unreal Engine 5.2 Integration, Adding DLSS 3 to Unreal Engine Games Simpler Than Ever

NVIDIA and Epic announced the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 into the popular Unreal Engine (UE) game engine. Unreal Engine is an open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool that gives game developers and creators the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge real-time 3D content, interactive experiences and immersive virtual worlds. The DLSS 3 plug-in will debut in UE 5.2, making it simpler for any developer to accelerate the performance of their game or application.

“NVIDIA DLSS 3 introduces truly impressive frame generation technology and the Unreal Engine 5.2 plug-in will offer developers a great choice for increased quality and performance of their games,” said Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering at Epic Games.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/6413186ab3aed37a4db47c36_-og-1200x630-copy2x/-og-1200x630-copy2x_798dba54-4e09-4914-b904-170363a9f0d7-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/6413186ab3aed37a4db47c36_-og-1200x630-copy2x/-og-1200x630-copy2x_798dba54-4e09-4914-b904-170363a9f0d7-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/6413186ab3aed37a4db47c36_-og-1200x630-copy2x/-og-1200x630-copy2x_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20232/6413186ab3aed37a4db47c36_-og-1200x630-copy2x/-og-1200x630-copy2x_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, contributions, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, restructuring costs and other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, foreign tax benefit and domestication tax adjustments. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CES—NVIDIA today announced GeForce RTX™ 40 Series laptops , powered by its ultra-efficient Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, which delivers the company’s largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency.

The new GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops are up to 3x more power efficient than the previous generation and bring the Ada architecture, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and fifth-generation Max-Q technologies to laptops for the first time. For gamers, RTX 40 Series laptops deliver up to 4x the performance in AAA games like full ray-traced Cyberpunk 2077 with new RT Overdrive Mode, and, for creators, they offer blazing-fast acceleration in top creative apps such as Blender.

“With the Ada architecture, we set out to transform the performance and power efficiency of gaming and creator laptops,” said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of the GeForce business at NVIDIA. “The new RTX 40 Series delivers enthusiast-class performance in laptops as slim as 14 inches, a new milestone.”

RTX 4090 and RTX 4080: A New Class of Flagship Laptops

The Ada architecture has also enabled a new class of enthusiast laptops that are the world’s fastest. Gamers can play on three 4K monitors for surround gaming at 60 frames per second — enough to power a professional-grade driving simulator. Creators can use the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform for photorealistic, 3D virtual world building at 4K with fully simulated physics, lighting and materials. Streamers can livestream games at 4K 60 fps with AV1 encoding to Discord, and Ada’s new dual encoders cut video export time in half. RTX 40 Series flagship laptops start at $1,999 and will be available beginning Feb. 8.

RTX 4070, 4060, 4050 Laptops: Faster Than Last-Generation Flagship at One-Third the Power

The new RTX 4070, 4060 and 4050 laptops are faster than the previous-generation flagship model, using as little as one-third the GPU power. They deliver 80 fps, 1440p ultra-gaming and transform creation processes like rendering scenes in Blender, which used to take two and a half hours, to just 10 minutes. RTX 4050 laptops start at $999 and will be available beginning Feb. 22.

Fifth-Generation Max-Q Technologies Improve Laptop Efficiency

With each new GPU generation since 2017, advancements in Max-Q technology have improved laptop design. Today, alongside the launch of the GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, NVIDIA is introducing its fifth-generation Max-Q technologies, which radically enhance efficiency and accelerate gaming performance using the following upgrades:

NVIDIA ® DLSS 3 has been optimized for laptops and built into Max-Q technologies, including Whispermode and BatteryBoost, which improve performance, acoustics and battery life by up to 2x.

has been optimized for laptops and built into Max-Q technologies, including Whispermode and BatteryBoost, which improve performance, acoustics and battery life by up to 2x. The lowest voltage GDDR6 memory ever, shipped in partnership with leading manufacturers.

Tri-speed memory control enables the GPU to switch to newer, lower-power memory states dynamically.

Ada’s on-chip memory has been optimized for Max-Q, doubling the bandwidth, increasing the size by 16x and improving clock gating.

14-Inch Laptops More Powerful Than Ever

Before the introduction of the Ada architecture, 95% of this fastest-growing laptop segment was limited to basic tasks and apps. Equipped with GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, 14-inch laptops can take on tasks that were previously impossible, such as ultra-fast 3D rendering in Blender and cutting-edge AI tools in popular apps like Adobe Photoshop or Premiere Pro.

Powered by RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, 14-inch laptops are also gaming powerhouses, up to twice as fast as a PlayStation 5 but one-sixth the size. Gamers can play graphically intense AAA games, like Cyberpunk 2077, with ray tracing and DLSS. Connecting the ultra-portable laptops to external monitors turns them into desktop-class gaming rigs or creator studios.

Purpose-Built for 110 Million Creators

The creator market continues to grow rapidly, surpassing more than 110 million professional and hobbyist PC creators. And 3D creation on NVIDIA hardware, specifically, is showing staggering growth — with a 42 percent increase since last year.

Laptops with GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs take advantage of the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem with RTX and Max-Q technologies to offer the ideal combination of efficiency and performance. The improved efficiency accelerates even the most demanding workflows with up to 3x longer battery life.

GeForce RTX laptop users benefit from NVIDIA Studio accelerations in over 110 of the most popular creative apps — plus exclusive access to AI-powered apps like NVIDIA Omniverse , Canvas and Broadcast . 3D artists can collaborate with one another in Omniverse from anywhere in the world, while video editors can produce on location faster with AI tools and cut export times in half with dual encoders.

SC22 -- NVIDIA today announced that NVIDIA Omniverse ™ — an open computing platform for building and operating metaverse applications — now connects to leading scientific computing visualization software and supports new batch-rendering workloads on systems powered by NVIDIA A100 and H100 Tensor Core GPUs.

NVIDIA also introduced fully real-time scientific and industrial digital twins for the high performance computing community, enabled by NVIDIA OVX ™, a computing system designed to power large-scale Omniverse digital twins, and Omniverse Cloud , a software- and infrastructure-as-a-service offering.

Omniverse now supports batch workloads that AI and HPC researchers, scientists and engineers can run on their existing A100 or H100 systems — including rendering videos and images or generating synthetic 3D data .

To foster more seamless, collaborative workflows for the HPC community, NVIDIA also unveiled connections to popular scientific computing tools such as Kitware’s ParaView , an application for visualization; NVIDIA IndeX ® for volumetric rendering; NVIDIA Modulus for developing physics-ML models; and NeuralVDB for large-scale sparse volumetric data representation.

“Today’s scientific computing workflows are extremely complex, involving enormous datasets that are impractical to move and large, global teams that use their own specialized tools,” said Dion Harris, lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. “With new support for Omniverse on A100 and H100 systems, HPC customers can finally start to unlock legacy data silos, achieve interoperability in their complex simulation and visualization pipelines, and generate compelling visuals for their batch-rendering workflows.”

Using Omniverse and hybrid-cloud workloads, scientific computing customers can connect legacy simulation and visualization pipelines to achieve distributed, fully interactive, true real-time interaction with their models and datasets. NVIDIA customers such as Argonne National Laboratory, Lockheed Martin and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory are already seeing benefits of Omniverse for HPC workloads.

Global Scientific Leaders Support Omniverse

Argonne National Laboratory is using NVIDIA Omniverse on its A100-powered Polaris supercomputer to connect its legacy visualization tools as a first step to developing the foundations for future digital twins.

“Visualization workflows at Argonne National Laboratory are getting increasingly complex — ranging from handling terabytes of cosmology data to photorealistic renderings of engineered devices — and these collaborative projects involve teams of scientists, engineers and artists all using highly specialized tools,” said Michael Papka, deputy associate laboratory director and director at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. “Omniverse homogenizes such complex workflows, retains the expertise of established tools and opens the opportunity for entirely new workflows, including building digital twins.”

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), the U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory for plasma physics and fusion science, is using Omniverse to connect and accelerate state-of-the-art, synthetic, real-time HPC simulators to model fusion devices and control systems, and ultimately improve the operation of the experiment toward a new commercially viable clean-energy source.

“Securing clean energy is a crucial goal for research scientists and engineers — as well as a major target for government organizations,” said William Tang, principal research physicist at PPPL and affiliated faculty at Princeton University’s Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. “A fully live, truly interactive scientific digital twin of a fusion device that enables real-time simulation workflows built on Omniverse will open doors to new abilities for generating clean power for a better future.”

Aligning with NVIDIA’s Earth-2 initiative to accelerate climate research, aerospace leader Lockheed Martin recently began using NVIDIA Omniverse to provide the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with better global environmental situational awareness and to develop an interactive climate research pipeline.

“At Lockheed Martin, we regularly use digital twins and artificial intelligence to provide our government customers with the clearest, current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions,” said Matt Ross, senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this Earth Observation Digital Twin project, where we will fuse together a tremendous amount of satellite and ground-based sensor data to provide NOAA a global visualization of their own important mission space.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/202210/637184a1b3aed32da8ac2034_NVIDIA%20Omniverse%20Portals/NVIDIA%20Omniverse%20Portals_ee7fa3d8-e355-4c6e-800e-2d3f6d4518f6-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/202210/637184a1b3aed32da8ac2034_NVIDIA+Omniverse+Portals/NVIDIA+Omniverse+Portals_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/202210/637184a1b3aed32da8ac2034_NVIDIA+Omniverse+Portals/NVIDIA+Omniverse+Portals_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/202210/637184a1b3aed32da8ac2034_NVIDIA%20Omniverse%20Portals/NVIDIA%20Omniverse%20Portals_ee7fa3d8-e355-4c6e-800e-2d3f6d4518f6-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

New Ray-Tracing Tech for Even More Immersive Games

For decades, rendering ray-traced scenes with physically correct lighting in real time has been considered the holy grail of graphics. At the same time, geometric complexity of environments and objects has continued to increase as 3D games and graphics strive to provide the most accurate representations of the real world.

Achieving physically accurate graphics requires tremendous computational horsepower. Modern ray-traced games like Cyberpunk 2077 run over 600 ray-tracing calculations for each pixel just to determine lighting — a 16x increase from the first ray-traced games introduced four years ago.

The new third-generation RT Cores have been enhanced to deliver 2x faster ray-triangle intersection testing and include two important new hardware units. An Opacity Micromap Engine speeds up ray tracing of alpha-test geometry by a factor of 2x, and a Micro-Mesh Engine generates micro-meshes on the fly to generate additional geometry. The Micro-Mesh Engine provides the benefits of increased geometric complexity without the traditional performance and storage costs of complex geometries.





Creativity Redefined With RTX Remix, New AV1 Encoders

The RTX 40 Series GPUs and DLSS 3 deliver advancements for NVIDIA Studio creators. 3D artists can render fully ray-traced environments with accurate physics and realistic materials, and view the changes in real time, without proxies.

Video editing and live streaming also get a boost from improved GPU performance and the inclusion of new dual, eighth-generation AV1 encoders. The NVIDIA Broadcast software development kit has three updates, now available for partners, including Face Expression Estimation, Eye Contact and quality improvements to Virtual Background.

NVIDIA Omniverse ™ — included in the NVIDIA Studio suite of software — will soon add NVIDIA RTX Remix , a modding platform to create stunning RTX remasters of classic games. RTX Remix allows modders to easily capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with powerful AI tools, and quickly enable RTX with ray tracing and DLSS.

Portal Is RTX ON!

RTX Remix has been used by NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios to reimagine Valve’s iconic video game Portal , regarded as one of the best video games of all time. Advanced graphics features such as full ray tracing and DLSS 3 give the game a striking new look and feel. Portal with RTX will be released as free, official downloadable content for the classic platformer with RTX graphics in November, just in time for Portal’s 15th anniversary.

GTC -- NVIDIA today introduced NVIDIA DRIVE™ Thor, its next-generation centralized computer for safe and secure autonomous vehicles.

DRIVE Thor, which achieves up to 2,000 teraflops of performance, unifies intelligent functions — including automated and assisted driving, parking, driver and occupant monitoring, digital instrument cluster, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and rear-seat entertainment — into a single architecture for greater efficiency and lower overall system cost.

The next-generation superchip comes packed with the cutting-edge AI capabilities first introduced in the NVIDIA Hopper™ Multi-Instance GPU architecture, along with the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU and NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU. DRIVE Thor with MIG support for graphics and compute uniquely enables IVI and advanced driver-assistance systems to run domain isolation, which allows concurrent time-critical processes to run without interruption. Available for automakers’ 2025 models, it will accelerate production roadmaps by bringing higher performance and advanced features to market in the same timeline.

“Advances in accelerated computing and AI are moving at lightspeed,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “DRIVE Thor is the superhero of centralized compute, with lightning-fast performance to deliver continuously upgradable, safe and secure software-defined supercomputers on wheels.”

Signaling the transportation industry’s support for this new supercomputing architecture, Geely-owned automaker ZEEKR announced it will integrate DRIVE Thor on its centralized vehicle computer for its next-generation intelligent electric vehicles, starting production in early 2025.

ZEEKR CEO An Conghui said: “ZEEKR users demand a luxury experience that includes the latest technology and safety features. NVIDIA DRIVE Thor will support our mission of providing cutting-edge technology that fulfills the needs of our customers and ensures ZEEKR remains at the forefront of tomorrow’s innovations.”

DRIVE Thor supports multi-domain computing, isolating functions for automated driving and IVI. Typically, dozens of electric control units are distributed throughout a vehicle to power individual functions. With DRIVE Thor, manufacturers can efficiently consolidate many functions on a single system-on-a-chip (SoC), which eases supply constraints and simplifies vehicle-design development, resulting in significantly lower cost, less weight and fewer cables.

DRIVE Thor is the first AV platform to incorporate an inference transformer engine , a new component of the Tensor Cores within NVIDIA GPUs. With this engine, DRIVE Thor can accelerate inference performance of transformer deep neural networks by up to 9x, which is paramount for supporting the massive and complex AI workloads associated with self driving.

Another advantage of DRIVE Thor is its 8-bit floating point (FP8) capability. Typically, developers lose neural-network accuracy when moving from 32-bit FP data to 8-bit integer format. DRIVE Thor features 2,000 teraflops of FP8 precision, allowing the transition to 8-bit without sacrificing accuracy.

The new superchip also uses the latest NVLink ® -C2C chip interconnect technology, while running multiple operating systems. The advantage of the NVLink-C2C is its ability to share, schedule and distribute work across the link with minimal overhead. This equips automakers with the compute headroom and flexibility to build software-defined vehicles that are continuously upgradeable through secure, over-the-air software updates.

“The shift to software-defined vehicles with centralized electronic architectures is accelerating, driving a need for more powerful and more energy-efficient compute platforms,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “The virtualization, high-speed data transfer and massive processing performance of NVIDIA DRIVE Thor can enable safer vehicles, better user experiences and potential new revenue streams.”

DRIVE Thor is designed for the highest levels of functional safety. NVIDIA has invested more than 15,000 engineering years into safety across its full stack. NVIDIA is the only company with a unified safety approach across its entire system, from the data center to the fleet. Safety is incorporated into every step of the company’s development process — including design, production and vehicle operation.

The DRIVE Thor SoC and AGX board are developed to comply with ISO 26262 standards. The software stack is designed for both ISO 26262 and ASPICE compliance. The Thor SoC and software are also designed and produced in alignment with ISO 21434, which provides the pathway for compliance with regulatory security such as UNECE Regulation 155.

DRIVE Thor replaces NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan™ and will be the follow-on to DRIVE Orin™, which is currently in production and delivers 254 TOPS of performance.

GTC—NVIDIA today announced two new large language model cloud AI services — the NVIDIA NeMo Large Language Model Service and the NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM Service — that enable developers to easily adapt LLMs and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, text summarization, chatbots, code development, as well as protein structure and biomolecular property predictions, and more.

The NeMo LLM Service allows developers to rapidly tailor a number of pretrained foundation models using a training method called prompt learning on NVIDIA-managed infrastructure. The NVIDIA BioNeMo Service is a cloud application programming interface (API) that expands LLM use cases beyond language and into scientific applications to accelerate drug discovery for pharma and biotech companies.

“Large language models hold the potential to transform every industry,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The ability to tune foundation models puts the power of LLMs within reach of millions of developers who can now create language services and power scientific discoveries without needing to build a massive model from scratch.”

NeMo LLM Service Boosts Accuracy With Prompt Learning, Accelerates Deployments

With the NeMo LLM Service, developers can use their own training data to customize foundation models ranging from 3 billion parameters up to Megatron 530B, one of the world’s largest LLMs. The process takes just minutes to hours compared with the weeks or months required to train a model from scratch.

Models are customized with prompt learning, which uses a technique called p-tuning. This allows developers to use just a few hundred examples to rapidly tailor foundation models that were originally trained with billions of data points. The customization process generates task-specific prompt tokens, which are then combined with the foundation models to deliver higher accuracy and more relevant responses for specific use cases.

Developers can customize for multiple use cases using the same model and generate many different prompt tokens. A playground feature provides a no-code option to easily experiment and interact with models, further boosting the effectiveness and accessibility of LLMs for industry-specific use cases.

Once ready to deploy, the tuned models can run on cloud instances, on-premises systems or through an API.

BioNeMo LLM Service Enables Researchers to Tap Power of Massive Models

The BioNeMo LLM Service includes two new BioNeMo language models for chemistry and biology applications. It provides support for protein, DNA and biochemical data to help researchers discover patterns and insights in biological sequences.

BioNeMo enables researchers to expand the scope of their work by leveraging models that contain billions of parameters. These larger models can store more information about the structure of proteins, evolutionary relationships between genes, and even generate novel biomolecules for therapeutic applications.

Cloud API Provides Access to Megatron 530B, Other Ready-Made Models

In addition to tuning foundation models, the LLM services include the option to use ready-made and custom models through a cloud API.

This gives developers access to a broad range of pretrained LLMs, including Megatron 530B. It also provides access to T5 and GPT-3 models created with the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework — now available in open beta — to support a broad range of applications and multilingual service requirements.

Leaders in automotive, computing, education, healthcare, telecommunications and other industries are using NeMo Megatron to pioneer services for customers in Chinese, English, Korean, Swedish and other languages.

“Dell and NVIDIA’s long tradition of collaborating on next-generation GPU-accelerated data centers has already enabled massive breakthroughs,” said Travis Vigil, senior vice president, portfolio and product management, Infrastructure Solutions Group, Dell Technologies. “Now, through a solution that brings NVIDIA’s powerful BlueField DPUs along with NVIDIA GPUs to our PowerEdge server platform, our continued collaboration will offer customers performance and security capabilities to help organizations solve some of the world’s greatest challenges.”

Running on BlueField, vSphere 8 supercharges the performance of workloads. By offloading to the DPU, customers can accelerate networking and security services, and save CPU cycles while preserving performance and meeting the throughput and latency needs of modern distributed workloads. The combination increases performance and efficiency, simplifies operations and boosts infrastructure security for data center, edge, cloud and hybrid environments.

“Distributed modern applications with AI/ML and analytics are driving the transformation of data center architecture by leveraging accelerators and providing better security as part of the mainstream application infrastructure,” said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager, VMware Cloud Platform Business, VMware. “Dell PowerEdge servers built on the latest VMware vSphere 8 innovations, and accelerated by NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, provide next-generation performance and efficiency for mission-critical enterprise cloud applications while better protecting enterprises from lateral threats across multi-cloud environments.”

NVIDIA AI Enterprise Support for VMware vSphere 8 Coming Soon

As NVIDIA-Certified™ Systems , the Dell PowerEdge servers will be able to run the NVIDIA and VMware AI-Ready Enterprise Platform, a solution that features the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite and VMware vSphere.

A comprehensive, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is optimized to enable organizations to use AI on familiar infrastructure. It is certified to deploy anywhere — from the enterprise data center to the public cloud — and includes global enterprise support to keep AI projects on track.

An upcoming release of NVIDIA AI Enterprise will bring support for new capabilities introduced in VMware vSphere 8, including the ability to support larger multi-GPU workloads, optimize resources and easily manage the GPU lifecycle.

Outlook

NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is as follows:

Revenue is expected to be $5.90 billion, plus or minus 2%. Gaming and Professional Visualization revenue are expected to decline sequentially, as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for NVIDIA’s new product generation. The company expects that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive.

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion and $1.82 billion, respectively.

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2023 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, contributions, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, domestication tax benefit, and foreign tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today announced a broad initiative to evolve Universal Scene Description (USD) , the open-source and extensible language of 3D worlds, to become a foundation of the open metaverse and 3D internet.

Working together with USD’s inventor, Pixar, as well as Adobe, Autodesk, Siemens and a host of other leading companies, NVIDIA will pursue a multi-year roadmap to expand USD’s capabilities beyond visual effects — enabling it to better support industrial metaverse applications in architecture, engineering , manufacturing , scientific computing , robotics and industrial digital twins .

At its SIGGRAPH special address , the company shared forthcoming updates to evolve USD. These include international character support, which will allow users from all countries and languages to participate in USD. Support for geospatial coordinates will enable city-scale and planetary-scale digital twins. And real-time streaming of IoT data will enable the development of digital twins that are synchronized to the physical world.

To accelerate USD development and adoption, the company also announced development of an open USD Compatibility Testing and Certification Suite that developers can freely use to test their USD builds and certify that they produce an expected result.

“Beyond media and entertainment, USD will give 3D artists, designers, developers and others the ability to work collaboratively across diverse workflows and applications as they build virtual worlds,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “Working with our community of partners, we’re investing in USD so that it can serve as the foundation for architecture, manufacturing, robotics, engineering and many more domains.”

Open-Source USD Resources and Leaders Supporting USD

NVIDIA is releasing a collection of free resources to speed USD adoption, including thousands of USD assets purpose-built to open up virtual-world building for users without 3D expertise. The company is also providing hundreds of on-demand tutorials, documentation and developer tools to help spread USD education.

“USD is a cornerstone of Pixar’s pipeline, and it’s seeing rapidly growing momentum as an open-source framework across not only VFX and animation, but now industrial, design and scientific applications,” said Steve May, chief technology officer at Pixar Animation Studios. “NVIDIA’s contributions to help evolve USD as the open foundation of fully interoperable 3D platforms will be a great benefit across industries.”

NVIDIA also announced investment in building USD plugins from popular 3D software ecosystems to NVIDIA Omniverse ™, a platform for connecting and creating virtual worlds based on Universal Scene Description. New beta releases include PTC Creo and SideFX Houdini, with Autodesk Alias and Autodesk Civil3D, Siemens Xcelerator and more in development.

“Siemens and NVIDIA are coming together to enable the industrial metaverse where the future of design, engineering and collaboration will occur,” said Dirk Didascalou, chief technology officer of Siemens Digital Industries. “We are excited to support USD in the Siemens Xcelerator platform and plan to collaborate with NVIDIA on the next generation of the format.”

At SIGGRAPH , NVIDIA is also bringing together hundreds of engineering and product leads across the USD ecosystem into working councils to help align on USD development priorities and get feedback on where NVIDIA can centralize development efforts. Among the many companies contributing to and supporting USD are Adobe, Autodesk, Pixar and Siemens.

“Autodesk has been closely involved in the development of USD from its early inception as a means of standardizing the exchange of 3D data in animation and visual effects workflows,” said Raji Arasu, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Autodesk. “We have long understood the importance of 3D interoperability and have already begun extending USD’s applications beyond media and entertainment to design, engineering and industrial applications. We are excited by the momentum behind USD from partners like NVIDIA, which we believe will help better realize the concept of the metaverse and all the workflows it unlocks for our customers.”

Innovators in media, gaming, robotics, industrial automation, retail and grocery are already adopting USD as their metaverse language of choice, including Kroger and Volvo Cars.

“The promise of USD is immense. At Volvo, we immediately understood the value of the open, extensible, interoperable 3D scene description for our metaverse projects. Being able to maintain assets as a single source of truth and bring them from virtual world to virtual world will be seamless in 3D internet consumer applications,” said Mattias Wikenmalm, senior expert of visualization at Volvo Cars.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20227/62f1a044b3aed30fe06225d1_nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description/nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description_36271f87-d6e4-485d-8b7a-33c9d38f9a36-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20227/62f1a044b3aed30fe06225d1_nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description/nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description_36271f87-d6e4-485d-8b7a-33c9d38f9a36-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20227/62f1a044b3aed30fe06225d1_nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description/nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20227/62f1a044b3aed30fe06225d1_nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description/nvidia-omniverse-universal-scene-description_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZGFmYTFhMjQtZmQwYS00MTE5LWJiZmYtZGJhNjQwMTNmZjFlLTEwMTg0ODU=/tiny/NVIDIA-CORPORATION.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

Shortfall versus outlook primarily driven by weaker Gaming revenue

Management to discuss financial results and outlook on Aug. 24 earnings call

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced selected preliminary financial results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022.

Second quarter revenue is expected to be approximately $6.70 billion, down 19% sequentially and up 3% from the prior year, primarily reflecting weaker than forecasted Gaming revenue. Gaming revenue was $2.04 billion, down 44% sequentially and down 33% from the prior year. Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.

The shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition to reducing sell-in, the company implemented pricing programs with channel partners to reflect challenging market conditions that are expected to persist into the third quarter.

Data Center revenue, though a record, was somewhat short of the company’s expectations, as it was impacted by supply chain disruptions.

Second quarter results are expected to include approximately $1.32 billion of charges, primarily for inventory and related reserves, based on revised expectations of future demand.

“Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory.



“NVIDIA has excellent products and position driving large and growing markets. As we navigate these challenges, we remain focused on the once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent computing for the era of AI,” he said.

“The significant charges incurred in the quarter reflect previous long-term purchase commitments we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty,” said Colette Kress, EVP and CFO of NVIDIA.

“We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. We plan to continue stock buybacks as we foresee strong cash generation and future growth,” she said.

The offer price of $210 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of NVIDIA’s common stock exceeding $210 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless Tutanota waives this condition, NVIDIA stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price.

NVIDIA cautions stockholders that Tutanota has stated it expects to extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, May 27, 2022. There is no guarantee that the conditions of the offer will be satisfied.

NVIDIA recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota’s offer because the offer requires that the closing price per share of NVIDIA’s common stock exceed the offer price, and the offer is subject to numerous additional conditions, including Tutanota obtaining financing for the offer. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time by providing notice in accordance with the Tutanota offering documents prior to the expiration of the offer, which is currently scheduled for 5 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Friday, May 27, 2022.

NVIDIA does not endorse Tutanota’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer or its mini-tender offer documents.

A mini-tender offer is an offer that would result in the bidder holding not more than 5% of a company’s outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to tender offers that would result in the bidder holding more than 5% of a company’s outstanding shares. Tutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies.

The SEC has cautioned investors about these offers, noting that “some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” The SEC’s guidance to investors on mini-tenders is available at https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsminitendhtm.html.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2023 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, domestication tax benefit, and foreign tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance.

COMPUTEX -- NVIDIA today announced that Taiwan’s leading computer makers are set to release the first wave of systems powered by the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip for a wide range of workloads spanning digital twins, AI, high performance computing, cloud graphics and gaming.

Dozens of server models from ASUS , Foxconn Industrial Internet, GIGABYTE , QCT , Supermicro and Wiwynn are expected starting in the first half of 2023. The Grace-powered systems will join x86 and other Arm-based servers to offer customers a broad range of choice for achieving high performance and efficiency in their data centers.

“A new type of data center is emerging — AI factories that process and refine mountains of data to produce intelligence — and NVIDIA is working closely with our Taiwan partners to build the systems that enable this transformation,” said Ian Buck, vice president of Hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. “These new systems from our partners, powered by our Grace Superchips, will bring the power of accelerated computing to new markets and industries globally.”

The coming servers are based on four new system designs featuring the Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip, which NVIDIA announced at its two most recent GTC conferences. The 2U form factor designs provide the blueprints and server baseboards for original design manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers to quickly bring to market systems for the NVIDIA CGX™ cloud gaming, NVIDIA OVX ™ digital twin and the NVIDIA HGX ™ AI and HPC platforms.

Supercharging Modern Workloads

The two NVIDIA Grace Superchip technologies enable a broad range of compute-intensive workloads across a multitude of system architectures.

The Grace CPU Superchip features two CPU chips, connected coherently through an NVIDIA NVLink®-C2C interconnect , with up to 144 high-performance Arm V9 cores with scalable vector extensions and a 1 terabyte-per-second memory subsystem. The breakthrough design provides the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy efficiency of today’s leading server processors to address the most demanding HPC, data analytics, digital twin, cloud gaming and hyperscale computing applications.

The breakthrough design provides the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy efficiency of today’s leading server processors to address the most demanding HPC, data analytics, digital twin, cloud gaming and hyperscale computing applications. The Grace Hopper Superchip pairs an NVIDIA Hopper™ GPU with a Grace CPU over NVLink-C2C in an integrated module designed to address HPC and giant-scale AI applications. Using the NVLink-C2C interconnect, the Grace CPU transfers data to the Hopper GPU 15x faster than traditional CPUs.

Broad Grace Server Portfolio for AI, HPC, Digital Twins and Cloud Gaming

The Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip server design portfolio includes systems available in single baseboards with one-, two- and four-way configurations available across four workload-specific designs that can be customized by server manufacturers according to customer needs:

NVIDIA HGX Grace Hopper systems for AI training, inference and HPC are available with the Grace Hopper Superchip and NVIDIA BlueField®-3 DPUs.

DPUs. NVIDIA HGX Grace systems for HPC and supercomputing feature the CPU-only design with Grace CPU Superchip and BlueField-3.

NVIDIA OVX systems for digital twins and collaboration workloads feature the Grace CPU Superchip, BlueField-3 and NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA CGX systems for cloud graphics and gaming feature the Grace CPU Superchip, BlueField-3 and NVIDIA A16 GPUs.

NVIDIA is extending its NVIDIA-Certified Systems ™ program to servers using the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip, in addition to x86 CPUs. The first certifications of OEM servers are expected soon after partner systems ship.

It also integrates ML models with weather and climate data, such as the ERA5 dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

Complementing Modulus, NVIDIA Omniverse is a real-time virtual world simulation and 3D design collaboration platform. It enables the real-time visualization and interactive exploration of digital twins using the output surrogate model from Modulus.

NVIDIA FourCastNet

Fourier neural operators and transformers enable the NVIDIA FourCastNet physics-ML model, trained on 10TB of Earth system data. As a step toward Earth-2 – the system announced by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse – FourCastNet emulates and predicts the behavior and risks of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers with greater confidence and up to 45,000x faster.

“Digital twins allow researchers and decision-makers to interact with data and rapidly explore what-if scenarios, which are nearly impossible with traditional modeling techniques because they’re expensive and time consuming,” said Karthik Kashinath, senior developer technology scientist and engineer at NVIDIA. “Central to Earth-2, NVIDIA’s FourCastNet enables the development of Earth’s digital twin by emulating the physics and dynamics of global weather faster and more accurately.”

Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy

The digital twins platform is also turbocharging simulation research for the layout of wind farms equipped with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy wind turbines , making it possible for the first time to use AI to accurately model the effects of turbine placement on their performance in a wide variety of weather scenarios. This is expected to lead to optimized wind park layouts capable of producing up to 20 percent more power than previous designs.

“The collaboration between Siemens Gamesa and NVIDIA has meant a great step forward in accelerating both the computational speed and the deployment speed of our latest algorithms development in such a complex field as computational fluid dynamics, and set the foundations for a strong partnership in the future,” said Sergio Dominguez, onshore digital portfolio manager at Siemens Gamesa.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20222/6238e0bab3aed32962671f71_scientific-digital-twins/scientific-digital-twins_05ccdebc-b32c-49c2-a623-be1b2057de97-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YjM5OGUyZDgtYzk5Zi00YjA4LTg3MTAtOGUxZjE0MGM4NDNmLTEwMTg0ODU=/tiny/NVIDIA-CORPORATION.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20222/6238e0bab3aed32962671f71_scientific-digital-twins/scientific-digital-twins_05ccdebc-b32c-49c2-a623-be1b2057de97-prv.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20222/6238e0bab3aed32962671f71_scientific-digital-twins/scientific-digital-twins_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20222/6238e0bab3aed32962671f71_scientific-digital-twins/scientific-digital-twins_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

GTC—NVIDIA today announced Omniverse Cloud, a suite of cloud services that gives artists, creators, designers and developers instant access to the NVIDIA Omniverse ™ platform for 3D design collaboration and simulation from up to billions of devices.

Among Omniverse Cloud’s services is Nucleus Cloud, a simple “one-click-to-collaborate” sharing tool that enables artists to access and edit large 3D scenes from anywhere, without having to transfer massive datasets. It also includes Omniverse Create , an app for technical designers, artists and creators to interactively build 3D worlds in real time; and View , an app for non-technical users to view Omniverse scenes streaming full simulation and rendering capabilities using the NVIDIA GeForce NOW™ platform, powered by NVIDIA RTX™ GPUs in the cloud.

“Designers working remotely collaborate as if in the same studio. Factory planners work inside a digital twin of the real plant to design a new production flow. Software engineers test a new software build on the digital twin of a self-driving car before releasing it to the fleet. A new wave of work is coming that can only be done in virtual worlds,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Omniverse Cloud will connect tens of millions of designers and creators, and billions of future AIs and robotic systems.”

Using Omniverse Cloud, creators can iterate, share and collaborate on models stored in Nucleus Cloud from anywhere, and instantly invite other collaborators to join a session by sending a link. Users or teams without high-end GeForce® or NVIDIA RTX systems — or the desire to stand up IT infrastructure — can take advantage of the full powers of Omniverse Create and View simply by subscribing to the Omniverse Cloud program.

In his keynote address at NVIDIA GTC , Huang showed a demo of the future of design featuring three human designers and one specialist Omniverse Avatar AI designer collaborating virtually in Omniverse Cloud, making design changes to an architectural project.

The team conversed using a standard web conferencing tool, while connected in a scene hosted in Nucleus Cloud. One human designer ran the Omniverse View app on their RTX-powered workstation, while the other two streamed Omniverse View from GeForce NOW to their laptop and tablet.

“At KPF, a global leader in architectural design, we value the ability of our designers to collaborate as seamlessly as possible by making cloud-first technologies available to them when they need it,” said Cobus Bothma, director of Applied Research at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. “Omniverse Cloud fits perfectly into that practice with the promise of excelling our visual and 3D design collaboration abilities by enabling our teams to work in Omniverse from any device, anywhere.”

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement

On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp. (SoftBank) announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction. NVIDIA intends to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge (the Arm Write-off) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.

Outlook

NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is as follows:

Revenue is expected to be $8.10 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2 percent and 67.0 percent, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the Arm Write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.60 billion.

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively, plus or minus 1 percent, excluding any discrete items.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, domestication tax benefit, and foreign tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The new Reflex games include iRacing, the world’s premier online racing simulator, Ubisoft’s Rainbow Six Extraction, and Sony’s award-winning, fighting-based action-adventure game God of War .

A New Monitor Category - 1440p Esports

With the global growth in esports, the demand for esports displays has been doubling each year. 1080p displays have ruled esports for over a decade — as the lower resolution has enabled higher frame rates and faster refresh rates. With today’s top GeForce RTX GPUs rendering esports games well above 360 fps at 1440p, the industry is primed for a change.

NVIDIA Research found that 1440p 27-inch displays can improve aiming by up to 3 percent over traditional 1080 24-inch displays when aiming at small targets. For competitive games where every millisecond counts, 3 percent can often make the difference between victory and defeat.

NVIDIA announced four new displays in the 1440p esports category . The ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz PG27AQN features a 360Hz refresh rate. The AOC AG274QGM - AGON PRO Mini LED, MSI MEG 271Q Mini LED, and ViewSonic XG272G-2K Mini LED all feature mini-LED with a 300Hz refresh rate. All come with NVIDIA Esports Vibrance, Dual-Format and Reflex Analyzer features.

NVIDIA Reflex Ecosystem Expands

Over 20 million GeForce gamers compete with Reflex each month. As the popularity of the Reflex platform grows, so does the Reflex hardware ecosystem. NVIDIA announced six new Reflex monitors and six new Reflex mice.

There are now over 50 Reflex mice and monitors from 16 partners — all utilizing the Reflex Latency Analyzer, which allows gamers to easily measure system latency with a single click of the mouse.

GeForce NOW: The Ultimate Cloud Gaming Platform for PC Gamers

More games, more devices and improved networks are being delivered to the GeForce NOW ecosystem. Today NVIDIA announced the extension of its partnership with Electronic Arts, bringing Battlefield 4 and Battlefield V to GeForce NOW, streaming today.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, and domestication tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Atos and NVIDIA today announced the Excellence AI Lab (EXAIL), which brings together scientists and researchers to help advance European computing technologies, education and research.

The lab’s first research projects will focus on five key areas enabled by advances in high performance computing and AI: climate research, healthcare and genomics, hybridization with quantum computing, edge AI/computer vision and cybersecurity.

Atos will develop an exascale-class BullSequana X supercomputer with NVIDIA’s Arm-based Grace CPU, NVIDIA’s next-generation GPU, Atos BXI Exascale Interconnect and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform .

Predicting and Addressing Climate Change

In an effort to more accurately predict climate change, researchers from Atos and NVIDIA will run new AI and deep learning models on Europe’s fastest supercomputer at the Jülich Supercomputing Center. Such giant-scale models can be used to predict the evolution of extreme weather events and their changing behavior due to global warming, and they will benefit greatly from exascale-class computing.

The JUWELS Booster system, based on Atos’ BullSequana XH2000 platform , with nearly 2.5 exaflops of AI and 3,744 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking, will help provide deeper understanding of climate change and more accurate long-term predictions of events, such as hurricanes, extreme precipitation, and heat and cold waves.

“Atos is strongly committed to its decarbonization objectives , which are to offset all of our residual emissions by 2028 to reach ‘net zero,’ and to reach the SBTi target to reduce our global carbon emissions under our control and influence by 50 percent by 2025,” said Andy Grant, vice president of global sales for HPC, AI and Quantum at Atos. “Many leading climate modeling centers, such as Meteo France , DKRZ , KNMI and AEMet , are using our BullSequana supercomputers to run their large weather and climate models, and the current EXAIL announcement is a clear demonstration of our commitment, one year after the creation of our Center of Excellence in Weather and Climate Modelling with ECMWF.”

“Climate change intensifies and increases the frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt entire regions, costing governments and economies hundreds of billions each year,” said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “The goal for EXAIL is to advance vital research to address pressing global challenges surrounding climate change.”

Accelerating Medical Research With HPC, Quantum and AI

Supercharging medical breakthroughs with computational genomics is revolutionizing drug discovery and healthcare. Atos’ Life Sciences Center of Excellence has partnered with 40 leading institutions to leverage HPC, quantum computing and AI to advance medical imaging, genomics and pharmaceuticals. The NVIDIA Clara™ healthcare application framework provides supercomputing performance for genomics, healthcare imaging and computational chemistry applications.

EXAIL will harness Atos’ advanced computing solutions and NVIDIA Clara to help healthcare researchers and providers accelerate drug discovery and design advanced diagnostic solutions using embedded, edge, data center and cloud platforms.

Advancing Quantum Research

Quantum computing holds the potential to solve complex problems in fields like drug discovery, climate research, machine learning, logistics and finance. But much research remains before quantum computers become viable.

Atos’ Quantum Learning Machine , a quantum software development and simulation appliance for the coming quantum computer era, enables researchers and engineers to develop and experiment with quantum software. It will use NVIDIA GPUs to help dramatically increase the speed and scale of quantum simulations. This will speed the research in quantum algorithms, quantum information science, new quantum processor architectures and hybrid quantum-GPU system architectures.

Accelerating Computer Vision

Using Atos’ edge appliances, such as its BullSequana Edge which runs on NVIDIA BlueField® DPUs , the research teams at EXAIL will work together to accelerate computer vision and 5G wireless infrastructure. Six Atos labs around the world dedicated to computer vision will be equipped with the latest NVIDIA Fleet Command™ technology for secure deployment and management of AI applications across distributed edge infrastructure.",http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

GTC—NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a powerful synthetic-data-generation engine that produces physically simulated synthetic data for training deep neural networks.

In its first implementations of the engine, the company introduced two applications for generating synthetic data: one for NVIDIA DRIVE Sim™, a virtual world for hosting the digital twin of autonomous vehicles, and another for NVIDIA Isaac Sim™, a virtual world for the digital twin of manipulation robots.

These two replicators allow developers to bootstrap AI models, fill real-world data gaps, and label the ground truth in ways humans cannot. Data generated in these virtual worlds can cover a broad range of diverse scenarios, including rare or dangerous conditions that can’t regularly or safely be experienced in the real world.

Autonomous vehicles and robots built using this data can master skills across an array of virtual environments before applying them in the physical world.

“Omniverse Replicator allows us to create diverse, massive, accurate datasets to build high-quality, high-performing and safe datasets, which is essential for AI,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology and Omniverse engineering at NVIDIA. “While we have built two domain-specific data-generation engines ourselves, we can imagine many companies building their own with Omniverse Replicator.”

Omniverse Replicator augments costly, laborious human-labeled real-world data, which can be error prone and incomplete, with the ability to create large and diverse physically accurate data tailored to the needs of AV and robotics developers. It also enables the generation of ground truth data that is difficult or impossible for humans to label, such as velocity, depth, occluded objects, adverse weather conditions or tracking the movement of objects across sensors.

Already an invaluable data-generation engine for NVIDIA’s DRIVE autonomous vehicle and Isaac robotics teams, Omniverse Replicator will be made available next year to developers to build domain-specific data-generation engines.

GTC—NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA Quantum-2, the next generation of its InfiniBand networking platform, which offers the extreme performance, broad accessibility and strong security needed by cloud computing providers and supercomputing centers.

The most advanced end-to-end networking platform ever built, NVIDIA Quantum-2 is a 400Gbps InfiniBand networking platform that consists of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 switch, the ConnectX-7® network adapter, the BlueField-3® data processing unit (DPU) and all the software that supports the new architecture.

The introduction of NVIDIA Quantum-2 comes as supercomputing centers are increasingly opening to multitudes of users, many from outside their organizations. At the same time, the world’s cloud service providers are beginning to offer more supercomputing services to their millions of customers.

NVIDIA Quantum-2 includes key features required for demanding workloads running in either arena. Supercharged by cloud-native technologies, it provides high performance with 400 gigabits per second of throughput and advanced multi-tenancy to accommodate many users.

“The requirements of today’s supercomputing centers and public clouds are converging,” said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of Networking at NVIDIA. “They must provide the greatest performance possible for next-generation HPC, AI and data analytics challenges, while also securely isolating workloads and responding to varying demands of user traffic. This vision of the modern data center is now real with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand.”

NVIDIA Quantum-2 Performance and Cloud-Native Capabilities

With 400Gbps, NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand doubles the network speed and triples the number of network ports. It accelerates performance by 3x and reduces the need for data center fabric switches by 6x, while cutting data center power consumption and reducing data center space by 7 percent each.

The multi-tenant performance isolation of NVIDIA Quantum-2 keeps the activity of one tenant from disturbing others, utilizing an advanced telemetry-based congestion control system with cloud-native capabilities that ensure reliable throughput, regardless of spikes in users or workload demands.

NVIDIA Quantum-2 SHARPv3™ In-Network Computing technology provides 32x more acceleration engines for AI applications compared with the previous generation. Advanced InfiniBand fabric management for data centers, including predictive maintenance, is enabled with the NVIDIA UFM® Cyber-AI platform.

A nanosecond-precision timing system integrated into NVIDIA Quantum-2 can synchronize distributed applications, like database processing, helping to reduce the overhead of wait and idle times. This new capability allows cloud data centers to become part of the telecommunications network and host software-defined 5G radio services.

NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand Switch

At the heart of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 platform is the new Quantum-2 InfiniBand switch. With 57 billion transistors on 7-nanometer silicon, it is slightly bigger than the NVIDIA A100 GPU with 54 billion transistors.

It features 64 ports at 400Gbps or 128 ports at 200Gbps and will be offered in a variety of switch systems up to 2,048 ports at 400Gbps or 4,096 ports at 200Gbps — more than 5x the switching capability over the previous generation, Quantum-1.

The combined networking speed, switching capability and scalability is ideal for building the next-generation of giant HPC systems.

The NVIDIA Quantum-2 switch is now available from a wide range of leading infrastructure and system vendors around the world, including Atos, DataDirect Networks (DDN), Dell Technologies, Excelero, GIGABYTE, HPE, IBM, Inspur, Lenovo, NEC, Penguin Computing, QCT, Supermicro, VAST Data and WekaIO.

NVIDIA Quantum-2, ConnectX-7 and BlueField-3

The NVIDIA Quantum-2 platform provides two networking end-point options, the NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NIC and NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU InfiniBand.

ConnectX-7, with 8 billion transistors in a 7-nanometer design, doubles the data rate of the world’s current leading HPC networking chip, the NVIDIA ConnectX-6.

Professionals at over 500 companies, including SHoP Architects, South Park and Lockheed Martin, are evaluating the platform. Since the launch of its open beta in December, Omniverse has been downloaded by over 50,000 individual creators.

“NVIDIA Omniverse connects worlds by enabling the vision of the metaverse to become a reality,” said Richard Kerris, vice president of the Omniverse development platform at NVIDIA. “With input from developers, partners and customers, we’re advancing this revolutionary platform so that everyone from individuals to large enterprises can work with others to build amazing virtual worlds that look, feel and behave just as the physical world does.”

The metaverse is an immersive and connected shared virtual world. In it, artists can create one-of-a-kind digital scenes, architects can create beautiful buildings and engineers can design new products for homes. These creations can then be taken into the physical world after they have been perfected in the digital world.

“Lots of companies are, and have been, talking about the metaverse, but NVIDIA is one of the few that is actually delivering on its promise,” said Jon Peddie, noted author, consultant and founder of Jon Peddie Research. “NVIDIA brings a broader understanding of the needs of designers of all types and has many of the tools they can use — for free. The NVIDIA Omniverse platform has the potential to transform nearly every industry by making truly collaborative, creative innovation possible in a common virtual space for the first time.”

Omniverse Ecosystem Expands

NVIDIA Omniverse has a swiftly growing ecosystem of supporting partners.

Key to Omniverse’s industry adoption is Pixar’s open-source USD — the foundation of Omniverse’s collaboration and simulation platform — enabling large teams to work simultaneously across multiple software applications on a shared 3D scene. This open standard foundation gives software partners multiple ways to extend and connect to Omniverse, whether through USD adoption and support, or building a plugin, or via an Omniverse Connector.

Apple, Pixar and NVIDIA have collaborated to bring advanced physics capabilities to USD, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices. Blender and NVIDIA have collaborated to provide USD support to the upcoming release of Blender 3.0 and the millions of artists who use the software.

NVIDIA is contributing USD and materials support in Blender 3.0 alpha USD, which will be available soon for creators.

“NVIDIA’s engineering efforts on integrating USD into Blender is exemplary for how the industry contributes to open source,” said Ton Roosendaal, chairman of the Blender Foundation. “Thanks to USD, Blender artists can have high-quality access to studio pipelines and collaboration platforms such as Omniverse.”

NVIDIA and Adobe are collaborating on a Substance 3D plugin that will unlock new material editing abilities for Omniverse and Substance 3D users. Artists and creators will be able to work directly with Substance Materials either sourced from the Substance 3D Asset platform or created in Substance 3D applications, creating a more seamless 3D workflow.

“Adobe is dedicated to an open and connected community of 3D designers,"" said Sebastien Deguy, vice president of 3D and Immersive at Adobe. ""As an industry standard, Substance will strengthen the Omniverse ecosystem by empowering 3D creators with access to Substance 3D materials.”

The NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem continues to grow, connecting industry-leading applications from software companies such as Adobe, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Blender, Clo Virtual Fashion, Epic Games, Esri, Golaem, Graphisoft, Lightmap, Maxon, McNeel & Associates, Onshape® from PTC, Reallusion, Trimble, and wrnch Inc.

Global Leaders Use Omniverse

Among the over 500 companies that have been evaluating Omniverse are:

Lockheed Martin is working with Omniverse for wildfire simulation, prediction and suppression. Its AI center of excellence has launched an initiative with NVIDIA called Cognitive Mission Management to develop a strategy for emergency response and fire suppression efforts.

“Using NVIDIA Omniverse and AI to simulate wildfires will help us to predict how quickly and in which directions they spread and to explore the effects of environmental variables like wind, moisture and ground cover on their behavior, so firefighting teams can better respond and reduce their damaging impact,” said Shashi Bhushan, principal AI software and systems architect at Lockheed Martin. “Our ultimate goal is to develop models that coordinate sensor data and real-time analysis to inform an AI that guides varying levels of human intervention.”

SHoP Architects, based in New York, is using Omniverse for real-time collaboration and visualization. Omniverse lets the firm’s team use the right software for the right task, and bring all the resulting data together in one place, where it can be extended and deployed using the platform.

“The ability to make decisions quickly and accurately across our interdisciplinary teams is core to SHoP's process,” said Geof Bell, associate, Digital Design and Delivery at SHoP Architects. “Omniverse will enable us to bring data from multiple experts together in a single authoritative way, curating it to present the right information at the right time, paired with high-quality visuals for intelligent, evocative design.”

South Park, the long-running, Emmy Award-winning animated television series, is exploring Omniverse to enable several of its artists to collaborate on scenes and optimize their insanely limited production time.

“NVIDIA Omniverse will give multiple animators at our studio the ability to collaborate on a single scene, simultaneously,” said J. J.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2022.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, mark to market adjustments of our publicly traded equity securities, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable, and domestication tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today launched TensorRT™ 8, the eighth generation of the company’s AI software, which slashes inference time in half for language queries -- enabling developers to build the world’s best-performing search engines, ad recommendations and chatbots and offer them from the cloud to the edge.

TensorRT 8’s optimizations deliver record-setting speed for language applications, running BERT-Large, one of the world’s most widely used transformer-based models, in 1.2 milliseconds. In the past, companies had to reduce their model size, which resulted in significantly less accurate results. Now, with TensorRT 8, companies can double or triple their model size to achieve dramatic improvements in accuracy.

“AI models are growing exponentially more complex, and worldwide demand is surging for real-time applications that use AI. That makes it imperative for enterprises to deploy state-of-the-art inferencing solutions,” said Greg Estes, vice president of developer programs at NVIDIA. “The latest version of TensorRT introduces new capabilities that enable companies to deliver conversational AI applications to their customers with a level of quality and responsiveness that was never before possible.”

In five years, more than 350,000 developers across 27,500 companies in wide-ranging areas, including healthcare, automotive, finance and retail, have downloaded TensorRT nearly 2.5 million times. TensorRT applications can be deployed in hyperscale data centers, embedded or automotive product platforms.

Latest Inference Innovations

In addition to transformer optimizations, TensorRT 8’s breakthroughs in AI inference are made possible through two other key features.

Sparsity is a new performance technique in NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs to increase efficiency, allowing developers to accelerate their neural networks by reducing computational operations.

Quantization aware training enables developers to use trained models to run inference in INT8 precision without losing accuracy. This significantly reduces compute and storage overhead for efficient inference on Tensor Cores.

Broad Industry Support

Industry leaders have embraced TensorRT for their deep learning inference applications in conversational AI and across a range of other fields.

Hugging Face is an open-source AI leader relied on by the world’s largest AI service providers across multiple industries. The company is working closely with NVIDIA to introduce groundbreaking AI services that enable text analysis, neural search and conversational applications at scale.

“We’re closely collaborating with NVIDIA to deliver the best possible performance for state-of-the-art models on NVIDIA GPUs,” said Jeff Boudier, product director at Hugging Face. “The Hugging Face Accelerated Inference API already delivers up to 100x speedup for transformer models powered by NVIDIA GPUs. With TensorRT 8, Hugging Face achieved 1ms inference latency on BERT, and we’re excited to offer this performance to our customers later this year.”

GE Healthcare, a leading global medical technology, diagnostics and digital solutions innovator, is using TensorRT to help accelerate computer vision applications for ultrasounds, a critical tool for the early detection of diseases. This enables clinicians to deliver the highest quality of care through its intelligent healthcare solutions.

“When it comes to ultrasound, clinicians spend valuable time selecting and measuring images. During the R&D project leading up to the Vivid Patient Care Elevated Release, we wanted to make the process more efficient by implementing automated cardiac view detection on our Vivid E95 scanner,” said Erik Steen, chief engineer of Cardiovascular Ultrasound at GE Healthcare. “The cardiac view recognition algorithm selects appropriate images for analysis of cardiac wall motion. TensorRT, with its real-time inference capabilities, improves the performance of the view detection algorithm and it also shortened our time to market during the R&D project.”",http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://ml.globenewswire.com/release/track/406d8922-3cf9-40c0-b500-10e5c0b8d647', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

NVIDIA today announced that there are now more than 130 games and applications supporting NVIDIA RTX™ acceleration technologies, including RT Core-accelerated ray tracing, NVIDIA® Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and Tensor Core-accelerated AI features. NVIDIA Reflex latency-reducing technology is also now supported in 12 of the top 15 competitive shooter-based games.

Since the launch of NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs two years ago, which introduced an array of technologies that have dramatically transformed PC gaming and content creation, NVIDIA has worked closely with game developers, creative application makers and industry standards bodies to leverage these innovations and create the new standard for PC games and content creation apps.

“RTX has set the standard, with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS pushing image quality and performance to levels that were previously unimaginable,” said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “Developers looking to deliver the best possible PC gaming experience rely on NVIDIA technologies to achieve that goal.”

The list of game franchises, game engines, game developers, game publishers and hardware/peripheral manufacturers using NVIDIA-pioneered game technologies is extensive. To date, over 60 RTX games support ray tracing or DLSS, while another 20 have adopted NVIDIA Reflex.

NVIDIA DLSS increases performance by up to 2x while maintaining crisp, clear image quality. This has led industry pundits to dub the technology “black magic” for overcoming the trade-off between performance and image quality that GPU makers have traditionally faced.

Adoption of DLSS technology has been swift, with support in Unreal Engine and Unity Engine, numerous private game engines and over 50 game titles. The all-star lineup of gaming franchises that use DLSS to deliver a new level of graphics includes Battlefield, Call of Duty, Control, Crysis, Cyberpunk, Death Stranding, DOOM, Final Fantasy, Fortnite, Marvel Avengers, Metro, Minecraft, Monster Hunter, Outriders, Red Dead Redemption, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Tomb Raider, War Thunder, Watch Dogs, Wolfenstein and more.

As part of the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem, an additional 70 content creation and design applications support RTX-accelerated ray tracing, DLSS or AI features, such as Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop, Magic Mask in Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve and AI Audio Noise Removal in OBS.

COMPUTEX 2021 Brings Even More RTX Games

This week’s COMPUTEX trade show brings a flood of new game announcements that add to the RTX title tally.

Games showcased during NVIDIA’s keynote address or at the event that will be adding both ray tracing and DLSS include The Ascent, DOOM Eternal, DYING : 1983, Icarus, LEGO® Builder’s Journey and The Persistence. New games that are accelerating performance using DLSS include Rainbow Six Siege and Red Dead Redemption 2.

The rapid adoption of RTX technologies presents a watershed moment for the game industry, and represents one of the fastest in the history of PC platform technologies. RTX technologies have quickly become ubiquitous in today’s biggest games, including the most popular game of all time, as well as the No. 1 battle royale and RPG games.

For creators and broadcasters, RTX is accelerating the No. 1 photography application — Adobe Photoshop; the No. 1 video editing application — Adobe Premiere Pro; the No. 1 broadcast application — OBS; and every major 3D renderer.

NVIDIA Reflex Supported in 12 of the Top 15 Competitive Shooters

NVIDIA Reflex is a suite of technologies that measure and optimize system latency in competitive games and improve PC responsiveness, making it easier for gamers to target opponents and hit their shots. Reflex is coming soon to CrossFire HD, Escape from Tarkov, Naraka: Bladepoint and War Thunder.

Only nine months after its launch, 12 out of the top 15 most played competitive shooters now support Reflex, including Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Destiny 2, Enlisted, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, Rust and Valorant.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2022.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, mark to market adjustments of our publicly traded equity securities, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today announced a new wave of GeForce RTX™ laptops from the world’s top manufacturers, delivering real-time ray tracing and AI-based DLSS to tens of millions more gamers and creators, starting at just $799.

The platforms, many based on the new GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and 3050 Laptop GPUs, bring NVIDIA’s Ampere architecture with dedicated RT and Tensor Cores to the most mainstream audience yet, and expand the number of RTX 30 Series laptops to more than 140.

Providing exceptional performance in thin, sleek designs, the new RTX laptops are twice as fast as previous-generation systems, delivering smooth, 60 frames per second gameplay at 1080p in popular titles such as Minecraft RTX and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.

“The latest wave of laptops provides the perfect opportunity to upgrade, particularly for gamers and creators with older laptops who want to experience the magic of RTX,” said Mark Aevermann, director of product management for laptops at NVIDIA. “There are now five times more RTX 30 Series gaming laptops that are thinner than 18mm compared with previous-generation RTX systems, delivering groundbreaking performance with very sleek and portable designs.”

NVIDIA DLSS - The Laptop Game Changer

Laptop owners, who typically upgrade after about four years of use, can see enormous performance gains with the newest GeForce RTX 3050-class Laptop GPUs. With NVIDIA DLSS, GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptops are also up to 2x faster than previous-generation systems.

Only GeForce RTX GPUs feature specialized Tensor Cores that power DLSS, which is now available in more than 40 AAA titles and indie game hits, with recent additions such as Outriders, Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT and Mortal Shell.

Additionally, creators can experience DLSS acceleration in applications such as D5 Render, SheenCity Mars and NVIDIA Omniverse™, which enable artists to visualize their designs in real time instead of waiting for ray-traced scenes to finish rendering.

“Consumers are spending more time than ever on laptops — PC gamers, creators and students are all driving demand for massive improvements in graphics horsepower and AI-accelerated applications,” said Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. “Laptop manufacturers are responding to this market momentum by designing thinner, higher-performing models to meet the various needs of consumers — it’s no wonder NVIDIA GPUs are powering so many new designs.”

NVIDIA Reflex Brings Low-Latency Esports to Laptops

For those who enjoy competitive games, new GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptops can deliver 144+ FPS and sub-25ms system latency in titles such as Overwatch , Rainbow Six Siege and Valorant, thanks to the NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency mode. Seven out of the top 10 competitive shooter games have NVIDIA Reflex support, which allows gamers to achieve lower system latency so they can play their absolute best. NVIDIA Reflex is also supported across the entire RTX 30 Series lineup.

New AI Effects for Video Conferencing and Livestreaming in NVIDIA Broadcast

All RTX 30 Series laptops include support for NVIDIA Broadcast , an app that transforms laptops into a home studio. This has now been improved with new AI effects — room echo removal and video noise removal — and updated the audio noise removal to eliminate sounds from cats, dogs and insects. These effects, together with the previously released virtual background and auto frame, can now be stacked to provide more control and quality over audio and video.

New NVIDIA Studio Laptops

RTX-based Studio laptops are designed for creators to meet their demands for performance and reliability. Newly unveiled NVIDIA Studio laptops equipped with RTX 30 Series GPUs now render creative and professional apps up to 2x faster than the previous generation. Video editors can work with 8K RAW footage, use AI to simplify workflows and reduce encode times by up to 75 percent. Additionally, artists can take advantage of up to 16GB of graphics memory to work with huge assets or multiple apps simultaneously for increased productivity and efficiency.

Availability

New GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, including GeForce RTX 3080, 3070 and 3060, are available starting today from the world’s top manufacturers, including Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI and Razer. RTX 3050 Ti and 3050-based laptops will be available this summer.

GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops will also be available from local OEMs and system builders, including Aftershock, CyberPower PC, Digital Storm, Eluktronics, Falcon NW, Hasee, Maingear, Mechrevo, Mouse, Origin PC, PC Specialist, Scan, Schenker, Terrans Force, Thunderobot and XOTIC PC.

Now available, the NVIDIA Jarvis framework provides developers with state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models and software tools to create interactive conversational AI services.

GTC -- NVIDIA today announced availability of the NVIDIA Jarvis framework, providing developers with state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models and software tools to create interactive conversational AI services that are easily adaptable for every industry and domain.

With billions of hours of phone calls, web meetings and streaming broadcast video content generated daily, NVIDIA Jarvis models offer highly accurate automatic speech recognition, as well as superhuman language understanding, real-time translations for multiple languages, and new text-to-speech capabilities to create expressive conversational AI agents.

Utilizing GPU acceleration, the end-to-end speech pipeline can be run in under 100 milliseconds — listening, understanding and generating a response faster than the blink of a human eye — and can be deployed in the cloud, in the data center or at the edge, instantly scaling to millions of users.

“Conversational AI is in many ways the ultimate AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Deep learning breakthroughs in speech recognition, language understanding and speech synthesis have enabled engaging cloud services. NVIDIA Jarvis brings this state-of-the-art conversational AI out of the cloud for customers to host AI services anywhere.”

NVIDIA Jarvis will enable a new wave of language-based applications previously not possible, improving interactions with humans and machines. It opens the door to the creation of such services as digital nurses to help monitor patients around the clock, relieving overloaded medical staff; online assistants to understand what consumers are looking for and recommend the best products; and real-time translations to improve cross-border workplace collaboration and enable viewers to enjoy live content in their own language.

Jarvis has been built using models trained for several million GPU hours on over 1 billion pages of text, 60,000 hours of speech data, and in different languages, accents, environments and lingos to achieve world-class accuracy. For the first time, developers can use NVIDIA TAO , a framework to train, adapt and optimize these models for any task, any industry and on any system with ease.

Developers can select a Jarvis pre-trained model from NVIDIA’s NGC™ catalog , fine-tune it using their own data with the NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit , optimize it for maximum throughput and minimum latency in real-time speech services, and then easily deploy the model with just a few lines of code so there is no need for deep AI expertise.

Broad Industry Support

Since Jarvis’ early access program began last May, thousands of companies have asked to join. Among early users is T-Mobile, the U.S. telecom giant, which is looking to AI to further augment its machine learning products using natural language processing to provide real-time insights and recommendations.

“With NVIDIA Jarvis services, fine-tuned using T-Mobile data, we’re building products to help us resolve customer issues in real time,” said Matthew Davis, vice president of product and technology at T-Mobile. “After evaluating several automatic speech recognition solutions, T-Mobile has found Jarvis to deliver a quality model at extremely low latency, enabling experiences our customers love.”

NVIDIA is also partnering with Mozilla Common Voice, an open source collection of voice data for startups, researchers and developers to train voice-enabled apps, services and devices. The world’s largest multi-language, public domain voice dataset, Common Voice contains over 9,000 total hours of contributed voice data in 60 different languages. NVIDIA is using Jarvis to develop pre-trained models with the dataset, and then offer them back to the community for free.

“We launched Common Voice to teach machines how real people speak in their unique languages, accents and speech patterns,” said Mark Surman, executive director at Mozilla. “NVIDIA and Mozilla have a common vision of democratizing voice technology — and ensuring that it reflects the rich diversity of people and voices that make up the internet.”

NVIDIA’s conversational AI tools have had more than 45,000 downloads. These can be combined with technology from hundreds of partners and support leading software libraries, allowing developers worldwide to build innovative and intuitive conversational AI applications.

“Jarvis has a wide selection of pre-trained models, making it a truly end-to-end pipeline for conversational AI — from automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and text-to-speech,” said Harrison Kinsley, YouTuber and founder of PythonProgramming.net. “All of the models are shockingly fast and well optimized and the API is easy for developers to use with examples that apply to many conversational AI tasks.”

The NVIDIA Morpheus application framework provides cybersecurity companies with a complete suite of accelerated AI skills that detect and prevent security threats as they happen.

GTC -- NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Morpheus application framework , which provides cybersecurity partners with a complete suite of accelerated AI skills that detect and prevent security threats as they happen.

NVIDIA Morpheus is a cloud-native cybersecurity framework which uses machine learning to identify, capture and take action on threats and anomalies that were previously impossible to identify, including leaks of unencrypted sensitive data, phishing attacks and malware. Deploying Morpheus with security applications takes advantage of NVIDIA AI computing and NVIDIA® BlueField®-3 DPUs to provide users the ability to protect their data center from its core to the edge.

“Zero-trust security models demand we monitor every transaction in the data center in real time. This poses a significant technical challenge – needing to sense intrusion within the server, detecting threats immediately, and operating at the data rate of modern data centers,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Morpheus combines Mellanox in-server networking and NVIDIA AI to do real-time, all-packet inspection to anticipate threats and eliminate them as they arise.”

Morpheus, when combined with BlueField DPUs, enables every compute node in the network to serve as a cyber-defense sensor at the edge, letting organizations analyze every packet with line-rate speed without data replication. In contrast, traditional AI security tools typically sample around five percent of network traffic data, leading to threat-detection algorithms based on incomplete models.

Morpheus applies real-time telemetry, policy enforcement and processing at the edge coupled with AI to analyze more security data without sacrificing cost or performance. Developers can also create their own Morpheus AI skills using deep learning models, leveraging existing IP investments.

AI-Enabled Security Ecosystem

Leading hardware, software and cybersecurity solutions providers are working closely with NVIDIA to optimize and integrate data center security offerings with the NVIDIA Morpheus AI framework. This includes industry leaders ARIA Cybersecurity Solutions , Cloudflare, F5, Fortinet and Guardicore, along with hybrid-cloud platform providers Canonical, Red Hat and VMware.

“Defending complex and evolving environments requires constant visibility,” said Adam Mishler, chief information security officer at Best Buy. “Providing real-time, dynamic network maps will help identify areas where we can further strengthen our posture and serve as a foundation for enhancing ML-based anomaly detection. The NVIDIA Morpheus framework helps provide a flexible and scalable platform for anomaly detection capable of adapting with the ever changing cyber-threat landscape.”

“With a rapidly expanding attack surface, our tools for advanced detection at the edge are becoming increasingly important,” said Aaron Sant-Miller, a chief data scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton. “We’ve partnered with NVIDIA to design, develop and deliver portable cyber AI tools that address this need. Morpheus is the foundation for our Cyber Precog Flyaway Kit, an AI-enabled cyber-hunt platform that packs data center compute into a small, ruggedized GPU form factor.”

“Splunk is excited to collaborate with NVIDIA to uncover more ways to utilize GPU-accelerated deep learning to enhance how we help our joint customers turn their data into doing,” said Tim Tully, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Splunk. “We look forward to using the Morpheus framework to potentially provide a path for our team to quickly prototype and integrate new capabilities in our platform, as well as offload compute-intensive tasks to GPU architectures to aid our customers.”

Additionally, Morpheus is optimized to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems ™ from the world’s leading server manufacturers, including Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, H3C, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.

‘Grace’ CPU delivers 10x performance leap for systems training giant AI models, using energy-efficient Arm cores

Swiss Supercomputing Center and US Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory First to Build NVIDIA CPU-Powered Supercomputers

GTC -- NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing , recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

Grace is a highly specialized processor targeting workloads such as training next-generation NLP models that have more than 1 trillion parameters. When tightly coupled with NVIDIA GPUs, a Grace CPU-based system will deliver 10x faster performance than today’s state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX™-based systems, which run on x86 CPUs.

While the vast majority of data centers are expected to be served by existing CPUs, Grace — named for Grace Hopper, the U.S. computer-programming pioneer — will serve a niche segment of computing.

The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers in support of national scientific research efforts.

NVIDIA is introducing Grace as the volume of data and size of AI models are growing exponentially. Today’s largest AI models include billions of parameters and are doubling every two-and-a-half months. Training them requires a new CPU that can be tightly coupled with a GPU to eliminate system bottlenecks.

NVIDIA built Grace by leveraging the incredible flexibility of Arm’s data center architecture. By introducing a new server-class CPU, NVIDIA is advancing the goal of technology diversity in AI and HPC communities, where choice is key to delivering the innovation needed to solve the world’s most pressing problems.

“As the world’s most widely licensed processor architecture, Arm drives innovation in incredible new ways every day,” said Arm CEO Simon Segars. “NVIDIA’s introduction of the Grace data center CPU illustrates clearly how Arm’s licensing model enables an important invention, one that will further support the incredible work of AI researchers and scientists everywhere.”

Grace’s First Adopters Push Limits of Science and AI

CSCS and Los Alamos National Laboratory both plan to bring Grace-powered supercomputers, built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, online in 2023.

”NVIDIA’s novel Grace CPU allows us to converge AI technologies and classic supercomputing for solving some of the hardest problems in computational science,” said CSCS Director Prof. Thomas Schulthess. “We are excited to make the new NVIDIA CPU available for our users in Switzerland and globally for processing and analyzing massive and complex scientific datasets.”

“With an innovative balance of memory bandwidth and capacity, this next-generation system will shape our institution’s computing strategy,” said Thom Mason, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. “Thanks to NVIDIA’s new Grace CPU, we’ll be able to deliver advanced scientific research using high-fidelity 3D simulations and analytics with datasets that are larger than previously possible.”

Delivering Breakthrough Performance

Underlying Grace’s performance is fourth-generation NVIDIA NVLink® interconnect technology, which provides a record 900 GB/s connection between Grace and NVIDIA GPUs to enable 30x higher aggregate bandwidth compared to today’s leading servers.

Grace will also utilize an innovative LPDDR5x memory subsystem that will deliver twice the bandwidth and 10x better energy efficiency compared with DDR4 memory. In addition, the new architecture provides unified cache coherence with a single memory address space, combining system and HBM GPU memory to simplify programmability.

Grace will be supported by the NVIDIA HPC software development kit and the full suite of CUDA® and CUDA-X™ libraries , which accelerate more than 2,000 GPU applications, speeding discoveries for scientists and researchers working on the world’s most important challenges.

NVIDIA is partnering with Schrödinger to harness NVIDIA DGX A100 systems to further expand the speed and accuracy of Schrödinger’s computational drug discovery platform and enable rapid, accurate evaluation of billions of molecules for potential development of therapeutics.

GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a strategic partnership with Schrödinger that harnesses NVIDIA DGX A100 ™ systems to further expand the speed and accuracy of Schrödinger’s computational drug discovery platform and enable rapid, accurate evaluation of billions of molecules for potential development of therapeutics.

The companies will optimize Schrödinger’s software platform — designed to model and predict the properties of novel molecules — for the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD ™, which is built with NVIDIA DGX A100 systems and NVIDIA InfiniBand HDR networking .

The work includes the physics-based modeling in Schrödinger’s product suite, as well as support for NVIDIA Clara ™ Discovery , a collection of state-of-the-art AI frameworks, applications and pre-trained models for the most advanced computational drug discovery. Additionally, the companies will partner on scientific and research breakthroughs to further advance physics-based computing and machine learning for drug discovery.

For each potential drug candidate, Schrödinger routinely evaluates tens of thousands of molecules with its most computationally intensive physics-based approaches. This requires hundreds of thousands of hours of GPU time on high-performance computers.

Through the collaboration, the entire pharmaceutical industry comprising over 3,000 companies — from startups to multinationals — will be able to further accelerate drug discovery at supercomputing scale. The joint solution will enable companies of all sizes to simulate molecular combinations with physics and AI to identify and optimize the most promising compounds for potential therapeutic use. Pharmaceutical companies can run this research on their own easy-to-deploy private clouds featuring the Schrödinger platform running on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD , which is available to install on premises or in a colocation facility.

“The predictive modeling built into our platform is designed to dramatically expand and accelerate the search for high-quality therapeutic molecules, and NVIDIA is a key technology partner in this work,” said Patrick Lorton, chief technology officer at Schrödinger. “Our advanced computational software helps the world’s biggest pharma companies explore more of the chemical space and reach high-quality candidates more quickly, with far less compute cost, than traditional methods. We’re proud to be working with NVIDIA to make that process run even more smoothly.”

NVIDIA research and engineering teams are working to advance and optimize the Schrödinger suite to take advantage of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture and its Multi-Instance GPU technology. Customers will be able to easily deploy Schrödinger software on a single DGX system or a cluster of 20 or more to create a DGX SuperPOD. This allows scaling the Schrödinger platform to dozens of drug programs and screening and evaluating billions of molecules a week.

“Computational drug discovery is improving accuracy with Schrödinger’s advanced combination of simulation with machine learning,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “Together, we’re giving the pharmaceutical industry a scientific instrument that delivers super-high-throughput lead generation to improve and accelerate the success of drug candidates.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20213/60747604ed6ae570f6d3e149_hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680/hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680_ae8b5b17-b112-44a2-9383-40614e5ede48-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20213/60747604ed6ae570f6d3e149_hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680/hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680_ae8b5b17-b112-44a2-9383-40614e5ede48-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20213/60747604ed6ae570f6d3e149_hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680/hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20213/60747604ed6ae570f6d3e149_hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680/hc-gtc-schrodinger-blog-header-1260x680_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

GTC -- NVIDIA today announced the coming general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse™ Enterprise , the world’s first technology platform that enables global 3D design teams working across multiple software suites to collaborate in real time in a shared virtual space.

NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise makes it possible for 3D production teams — which are often large, diverse in skills and geographically dispersed — to work seamlessly together on complex projects. Rather than requiring in-person meetings or exchanging and iterating on massive files, designers, artists and reviewers can work simultaneously in a virtual world from anywhere, on any device.

NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise has been in early evaluations with some of the world’s most sophisticated design teams at companies like BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP. It follows the launch three months ago of an open beta for individuals, which has been downloaded by nearly 17,000 users.

“Every few decades, technologies converge to enable a whole new thing – Omniverse is such an invention,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Building on NVIDIA’s entire body of work, Omniverse lets us create and simulate shared virtual 3D worlds that obey the laws of physics. The immediate applications of Omniverse are incredible, from connecting design teams for remote collaboration to simulating digital twins of factories and robots. The science-fiction metaverse is near.”

Omniverse Enterprise is a new platform that includes the NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus server, which manages the database shared among clients, and NVIDIA Omniverse Connectors , which are plugins to industry-leading design applications.

It also includes two end-user applications: NVIDIA Omniverse Create — which accelerates scene composition and allows users in real time to interactively assemble, light, simulate and render scenes — and NVIDIA Omniverse View , which powers seamless collaborative design and visualization of architectural and engineering projects with photorealistic rendering. NVIDIA RTX™ Virtual Workstation (vWS) software, also part of the platform, gives collaborators the freedom to run their graphics-intensive 3D applications from anywhere.

Omniverse Enterprise is tested and optimized for professionals to run on NVIDIA RTX laptops and desktops as well as NVIDIA-Certified Systems™ on the NVIDIA EGX™ platform. This makes it possible to deploy the tool across organizations of any scale, from small workgroups using local desktops and laptops, to globally distributed teams accessing the data center using various devices.

Global Leaders Adopt Omniverse

Among the more than 400 companies that have been evaluating Omniverse over the past two years are:

The BMW Group is the first car manufacturer to use NVIDIA Omniverse to design an end-to-end digital twin of an entire factory. Thousands of planners, product engineers, facility managers and lean experts within the global production network are able to collaborate in a single virtual environment to design, plan, engineer, simulate and optimize extremely complex manufacturing systems before a factory is actually built or a new product is integrated.

“NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA AI give us the chance to simulate all 31 factories in our production network. All elements of the complete factory model — including the associates, the robots, the buildings and the assembly parts — can be simulated to support a wide range of AI-enabled use cases such as virtual factory planning, autonomous robots, predictive maintenance and big data analytics,” said Milan Nedeljkovic, member of the board of management of BMW AG, responsible for production. “These new innovations will reduce the planning times, improve flexibility and precision, and at the end produce 30 percent more efficient planning processes. Omniverse is a game-changer that is setting the standard for collaboration platforms for our industry.”

Industrial Light & Magic has been evaluating Omniverse for a broad range of possible workflows, but particularly for bringing together content created across multiple traditional applications, and facilitating simultaneous collaboration across teams that are distributed all over the world. Omniverse has the potential to remove the technical barriers that used to get in the way of the creative process, facilitating real-time decision-making across all disciplines.

Foster + Partners , the U.K. architectural design and engineering firm, is implementing Omniverse to enable seamless collaborative design to visualization capabilities to teams spread across 14 countries.

“Omniverse is a revolutionary platform that has allowed our designers to collaborate and visualize multiple design changes to a scene simultaneously while working on their software of choice,” said Martha Tsigkari, partner with the Applied Research and Development Group at Foster + Partners. “As we can review design options in parallel, we have much more time for creative design and visualization. Integration of futuristic technologies such as machine learning will bring more opportunities to assist the creative process in the future.”

WPP, the world’s largest marketing services organization, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to reinvent the way advertising content is made by replacing traditional on-location production methods with entirely virtual production. When COVID-19 restrictions were put in place, the WPP team faced limitations shooting commercials for clients on location. They used the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to collaboratively design, build and simulate a photoreal virtual forest without having to shoot it in person.

“WPP’s global content production specialist Hogarth is the largest of its kind in the world. We manage over 1,500 shoots per year for our clients,” said Richard Glasson, Global CEO of Hogarth. “Omniverse has improved the way we work by enabling multiple artists at different touchpoints in the pipeline to collaborate on a single scene virtually at the same time and from any place in the world. It dramatically reduces our carbon footprint and brings sustainable production to life.”

Ericsson, a leading telecommunications company, is using the Omniverse platform to simulate and visualize future 5G networks.

“The NVIDIA Omniverse platform lets our teams virtually explore any city’s unique geography — whether it is San Francisco’s hills or Frankfurt’s high-rises — and its impact on radio network performance,” said Joakim Sorelius, head of Development Unit Networks at Ericsson. “By combining our extensive simulation expertise with the stunning visualizations of Omniverse, we bring radio network analysis to a new level, creating insights that ensure our customers get the best possible 5G experience. We see Omniverse as the future of collaboration and planning.”

Activision Publishing, Inc., is exploring NVIDIA Omniverse’s AI-search capabilities for its award-winning, blockbuster video game experiences to allow artists, game developers and designers to search intuitively through massive databases of untagged 3D assets using text or images.

Building the Metaverse — Open Standards and Interoperability

The world’s 3D industries are making great strides toward building the metaverse — a massive shared virtual world — by adopting open file frameworks like Pixar’s Universal Scene Description, and encouraging interoperability between software applications. The NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem continues to grow, connecting industry-leading applications from software companies such as Bentley Systems, Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, ESRI, Graphisoft, Trimble, McNeel & Associates, Blender, Marvelous Designer, Reallusion and wrnch Inc.

Bentley Systems , the infrastructure engineering software company, announced it is bringing infrastructure digital twins to NVIDIA Omniverse. Bentley is the first to harness real-time rendering, AI and simulation capabilities of NVIDIA Omniverse.

“Q4 was another record quarter, capping a breakout year for NVIDIA’s computing platforms,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our pioneering work in accelerated computing has led to gaming becoming the world’s most popular entertainment, to supercomputing being democratized for all researchers, and to AI emerging as the most important force in technology.

“Demand for GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs is incredible. NVIDIA RTX has started a major upgrade cycle as gamers jump to ray tracing, DLSS and AI.

“Our A100 universal AI data center GPUs are ramping strongly across cloud-service providers and vertical industries. Thousands of companies across the world are applying NVIDIA AI to create cloud-connected products with AI services that will transform the world’s largest industries. We are seeing the smartphone moment for every industry.

“Mellanox has expanded our footprint across the data center. And we are making good progress toward acquiring Arm, which will create enormous new opportunities for the entire ecosystem,” he said.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NIO, a pioneer in China’s premium smart electric vehicle market, and NVIDIA announced today that the automaker has selected the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.

NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022.

“Autonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. “We are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution — leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future.”

“The cooperation of NIO and NVIDIA will accelerate the development of autonomous driving on smart vehicles. NIO’s in-house developed autonomous driving algorithms will be running on four industry-leading NVIDIA Orin processors, delivering an unprecedented 1000+ TOPS in production cars,” said William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO.

Adam signals a major achievement by NIO in bringing automotive intelligence and autonomous driving to market, safely and reliably. With a centralized, software-defined computing architecture, NIO’s next-generation EVs, like the ET7 sedan, will feature the latest AI-enabled capabilities, which are perpetually upgradable after the point of sale.

NVIDIA Orin is the world’s highest-performance AV and robotics processor. This scalable supercomputer-on-a-chip family delivers an unprecedented 254 trillions of operations per second (TOPS) while also being able to scale down to entry-level ADAS/Level 2 use cases (10 TOPS/5 watts). NIO will feature four high-performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry-leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS — delivering the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation.

As the first of NIO’s EVs to feature Orin, the flagship ET7 is a high-performance vehicle that accelerates from zero to 100km in only 3.9 seconds. It also features a new 150kw battery for extended mileage range.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201911/5df98c262cfac22a57e0b5b9_NVIDIA%20Orin%20press/NVIDIA%20Orin%20press_062c3bef-f35d-4b77-a67c-3f52a7ff3da6-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201911/5df98c262cfac22a57e0b5b9_NVIDIA+Orin+press/NVIDIA+Orin+press_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201911/5df98c262cfac22a57e0b5b9_NVIDIA+Orin+press/NVIDIA+Orin+press_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201911/5df98c262cfac22a57e0b5b9_NVIDIA%20Orin%20press/NVIDIA%20Orin%20press_062c3bef-f35d-4b77-a67c-3f52a7ff3da6-prv.jpg'}"

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, legal settlement costs, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today announced its AI computing platform has again smashed performance records in the latest round of MLPerf, extending its lead on the industry’s only independent benchmark measuring AI performance of hardware, software and services.

NVIDIA won every test across all six application areas for data center and edge computing systems in the second version of MLPerf Inference. The tests expand beyond the original two for computer vision to include four covering the fastest-growing areas in AI: recommendation systems, natural language understanding, speech recognition and medical imaging.

Organizations across a wide range of industries are already tapping into the NVIDIA® A100 Tensor Core GPU’s exceptional inference performance to take AI from their research groups into daily operations. Financial institutions are using conversational AI to answer customer questions faster; retailers are using AI to keep shelves stocked; and healthcare providers are using AI to analyze millions of medical images to more accurately identify disease and help save lives.

“We’re at a tipping point as every industry seeks better ways to apply AI to offer new services and grow their business,” said Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “The work we’ve done to achieve these results on MLPerf gives companies a new level of AI performance to improve our everyday lives.”

GTC — NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Maxine platform, which provides developers with a cloud-based suite of GPU-accelerated AI video conferencing software to enhance streaming video — the internet’s No. 1 source of traffic.

NVIDIA Maxine is a cloud-native streaming video AI platform that makes it possible for service providers to bring new AI-powered capabilities to the more than 30 million web meetings estimated to take place every day. Video conference service providers running the platform on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud can offer users new AI effects -- including gaze correction, super-resolution, noise cancellation, face relighting and more.

Because the data is processed in the cloud rather than on local devices, end users can enjoy the new features without any specialized hardware.

“Video conferencing is now a part of everyday life, helping millions of people work, learn and play, and even see the doctor,” said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Maxine integrates our most advanced video, audio and conversational AI capabilities to bring breakthrough efficiency and new capabilities to the platforms that are keeping us all connected.”

Breakthrough AI Efficiency Slashes Bandwidth to Boost Call Quality

The NVIDIA Maxine platform dramatically reduces how much bandwidth is required for video calls. Instead of streaming the entire screen of pixels, the AI software analyzes the key facial points of each person on a call and then intelligently re-animates the face in the video on the other side. This makes it possible to stream video with far less data flowing back and forth across the internet.

Using this new AI-based video compression technology running on NVIDIA GPUs, developers can reduce video bandwidth consumption down to one-tenth of the requirements of the H.264 streaming video compression standard. This cuts costs for providers and delivers a smoother video conferencing experience for end users, who can enjoy more AI-powered services while streaming less data on their computers, tablets and phones.

AI Features Improve Video Conferencing Experiences

New breakthroughs by NVIDIA researchers that will be included in Maxine make video conferencing feel more like face-to-face conversation. Video conference service providers will be able to take advantage of NVIDIA research in GANs , or generative adversarial networks , to offer a variety of new features.

For example, face alignment enables faces to be automatically adjusted so that people appear to be facing each other during a call, while gaze correction helps simulate eye contact, even if the camera isn’t aligned with the user’s screen. With video conferencing growing by 10x since the beginning of the year, these features help people stay engaged in the conversation rather than looking at their camera.

Developers can also add features that allow call participants to choose their own animated avatars with realistic animation automatically driven by their voice and emotional tone in real time. An auto frame option allows the video feed to follow the speaker even if they move away from the screen.

Using conversational AI features powered by the NVIDIA Jarvis SDK, developers can integrate virtual assistants that use state-of-the-art AI language models for speech recognition, language understanding and speech generation. The virtual assistants can take notes, set action items and answer questions in human-like voices. Additional conversational AI services such as translations, closed captioning and transcriptions help ensure participants can understand what is being discussed on the call.

Cloud-Native Architecture Delivers Savings and AI at Scale

Demand for video conferencing at any given time can be hard to predict, with hundreds or even thousands of users potentially trying to join the same call. NVIDIA Maxine takes advantage of AI microservices running in Kubernetes container clusters on NVIDIA GPUs to help developers scale their services according to real-time demands. Users can run multiple AI features simultaneously while remaining well within application latency requirements.

Video conference service providers can use Maxine to deliver leading AI capabilities to hundreds of thousands of users by running AI inference workloads on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud. The modular design of the Maxine platform enables developers to easily select AI capabilities to integrate into their video conferencing solutions.

All-Star Suite of NVIDIA AI Developer Tools

The Maxine platform integrates technology from several NVIDIA AI SDKs and APIs. In addition to NVIDIA Jarvis, the Maxine platform leverages the NVIDIA DeepStream high-throughput audio and video streaming SDK and the NVIDIA TensorRT ™ SDK for high-performance deep learning inference.

The AI audio, video and natural language capabilities provided in the NVIDIA SDKs used in the Maxine platform were developed through hundreds of thousands of training hours on NVIDIA DGX ™ systems , the world’s leading platform for training, inference and data science workloads.

GTC – Tens of millions of designers, architects and other creators will soon be able to collaborate in real time, whether on premises or remotely, with the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform, which NVIDIA today announced has entered open beta, with availability for download this fall.

Bringing together NVIDIA breakthroughs in graphics, simulation and AI, Omniverse is the world’s first NVIDIA RTX™-based 3D simulation and collaboration platform that fuses the physical and virtual worlds to simulate reality in real time and with photorealistic detail.

Using the platform, remote teams can collaborate simultaneously on projects – such as architects iterating on 3D building design, animators revising 3D scenes, and engineers collaborating on autonomous vehicles – as readily as they would jointly edit a document online.

The open beta of Omniverse follows a yearlong early access program in which Ericsson, Foster + Partners, ILM and over 40 other companies – and as many as 400 individual creators and developers – have been evaluating the platform and providing feedback to the NVIDIA engineering team.

“Physical and virtual worlds will increasingly be fused,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, who revealed the open beta in his digital keynote address at the GPU Technology Conference. “Omniverse gives teams of creators spread around the world or just working from home the ability to collaborate on a single design as easily as editing a document. This is the beginning of the Star Trek Holodeck, realized at last.”

Omniverse is based on Pixar’s widely adopted Universal Scene Description (USD), the leading format for universal interchange between 3D applications. The platform also uses NVIDIA technology such as real-time photorealistic rendering, physics, materials and interactive workflows between industry-leading 3D software products.

Omniverse enables collaboration and simulation that are essential for customers working in the robotics, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction, manufacturing, and media and entertainment industries.

“We’ve had a longstanding collaboration with NVIDIA around our production workflows using their GPUs,” said Steve May, CTO at Pixar. “And with their adoption of Pixar’s Universal Scene Description for Omniverse, it continues even more so; together we are committed to advancing the state of the art in computer graphics.”

“Omniverse represents the platform of the future for all aspects of virtual production,” said Bill Warner, Avid Technology founder and chairman of Lightcraft Technology. “We’ve been actively evaluating this platform from NVIDIA and have made the decision to base our entire product line on this amazing new technology.”

Global Leaders Turn to Omniverse to Collaborate

Industrial Light & Magic, a Lucasfilm company and global leader in visual effects for motion pictures and television, calls out the importance of having the ability to improve creative process and animation pipelines.

“NVIDIA continues to advance state-of-the-art graphics hardware, and Omniverse showcases what is possible with real-time ray tracing,” said Francois Chardavoine, vice president of Technology at Lucasfilm and ILM. “The potential to improve the creative process through all stages of VFX and animation pipelines will be transformative.”

NVIDIA and Epic Games today announced that Fortnite — the epitome of battle royale gaming and a cultural phenomenon with more than 350 million players worldwide — is adding real-time ray tracing, AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS and other groundbreaking technologies, making the game more beautiful and even more responsive.

The game was featured today as part of a GeForce® special event where NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the new GeForce RTX™ 30 Series GPUs .

“Epic Games is turning Fortnite, which is already a pop culture sensation, into a showcase for how competitive gaming will improve with technology,” said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of Global GeForce Marketing at NVIDIA. “Fortnite players are about to experience the stunning visuals of next-level ray tracing, AI-accelerated frame rates powered by NVIDIA DLSS, and our new low-latency esports technology suite, NVIDIA Reflex.”

NVIDIA RTX™ GPUs are the only ones on the market with hardware support for ray tracing and AI. Gamers will experience these features in all Fortnite modes, as well as in a special new Creative mode map, called RTX Treasure Run, which has been specifically designed to highlight ray tracing.

“The GeForce RTX 30 Series is a testament to NVIDIA’s dedication to ray tracing and artificial intelligence,” said Marcus Wassmer, engineering director of Graphics at Epic Games. “Second-generation ray tracing, innovative use of AI with DLSS, and a large raw performance boost make the GeForce RTX 30 Series a truly impressive powerhouse for graphics technology in gaming.”

Ray Tracing Comes to Fortnite

Fortnite will add four ray-traced features , for a more immersive gaming experience. These include:

Ray-traced reflections – Recreates the way light reflects on glossy and metal surfaces, including smooth natural mirrors like window glass and rougher surfaces like brushed metal.

Ray-traced shadows – Accurately models shadowing on many surfaces while enhancing surface and contact detail, and fixes problems associated with traditional shadow techniques.

Ray-traced global illumination – Calculates world lighting with massively increased precision, illuminating Fortnite’s environments, players and characters with unprecedented detail, fidelity and clarity.

Ray-traced ambient occlusion – Where objects or surfaces meet, light is occluded, creating subtle shadows that can highlight the slightest of surface details.

All told, ray tracing will bring a new level of detail and realism to Fortnite’s Battle Royale, Creative and Save the World modes.

Using AI to Boost Performance and Image Quality in Fortnite

NVIDIA DLSS , which uses AI and is powered by RTX Tensor Cores, is a deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates and generates beautiful, sharp images for games. It provides gamers the performance headroom to maximize quality settings and increase output resolution.

NVIDIA Reflex Comes to Fortnite

Fortnite is one of the first games to support NVIDIA Reflex , which measures and reduces system latency. Reflex allows gamers to improve responsiveness, increase aiming precision and tune their system for battle.

“NVIDIA Reflex technology arms developers with new features to minimize latency in their games. We’re seeing excellent responsiveness and player control with Fortnite running on the GeForce RTX 30 Series,” said Nick Penwarden, vice president of Engineering at Epic Games.

System latency is the time it takes for a player’s actions to appear as pixels on the monitor and quantifies how the game feels. In games like Fortnite, NVIDIA Reflex low-latency mode dynamically reduces system latency by up to 42 percent in GPU-bound scenarios.

New Fortnite RTX Treasure Run Map Spotlights Ray Tracing

NVIDIA and Epic collaborated with top Fortnite creators on the new RTX Treasure Run map, which highlights the new technologies Fortnite is adding. The map drops players at the entrance to a museum where they are challenged to a scavenger hunt that highlights different ray-traced effects.

Along the way, players can explore a hall of mirrors, medieval castle and jungle, climb a giant statue and explore a shrunken science lab to uncover the most treasures in the least amount of time. RTX Treasure Run is coming soon.

The new features are coming soon to Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 4 for PC players and make Fortnite a flagship title for next-generation gaming technologies.

Screenshots, game trailers and in-game footage are available on NVIDIA’s press site at www.nvidia-press.com .

Mellanox growth accelerated in its first quarter as part of NVIDIA, contributed 14 percent of revenue

NVIDIA today reported record revenue for the second quarter ended July 26, 2020, of $3.87 billion, up 50 percent from $2.58 billion a year earlier, and up 26 percent from $3.08 billion in the previous quarter.

GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.99, up 10 percent from $0.90 a year ago, and down 33 percent from $1.47 in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.18, up 76 percent from $1.24 a year earlier, and up 21 percent from $1.80 in the previous quarter.

NVIDIA closed its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. on April 27, 2020.

“Adoption of NVIDIA computing is accelerating, driving record revenue and exceptional growth,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Growth in GeForce gaming accelerated as gamers increasingly immerse themselves in realistic virtual worlds created by NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI.

“Our new Ampere GPU architecture is sprinting out of the blocks, with the world’s top cloud service providers and server makers moving quickly to offer NVIDIA accelerated computing. Mellanox grew sharply, driven by the need for high-speed networking in cloud data centers to scale-out AI services. And Mercedes-Benz’s partnership with NVIDIA to power its next-generation fleet of luxury cars -- from the computer to the AI software, and from the cloud to the car -- is transformative.

“Despite the pandemic’s impact on our professional visualization and automotive platforms, we are well positioned to grow, as gaming, AI, cloud computing and autonomous machines drive the next industrial revolution around the world,” he said.

NVIDIA paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends in the second quarter. It will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share on September 24, 2020, to all shareholders of record on September 2, 2020.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2021 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, legal settlement costs, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

ISC Digital—NVIDIA and the world’s leading server manufacturers today announced NVIDIA A100-powered systems in a variety of designs and configurations to tackle the most complex challenges in AI, data science and scientific computing.

More than 50 A100-powered servers from leading vendors around the world — including ASUS, Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo, One Stop Systems, Quanta/QCT and Supermicro — are expected following last month’s launch of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture and the NVIDIA A100 GPU .

Availability of the servers varies, with 30 systems expected this summer, and over 20 more by the end of the year.

“Adoption of NVIDIA A100 GPUs into leading server manufacturers’ offerings is outpacing anything we’ve previously seen,” said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “The sheer breadth of NVIDIA A100 servers coming from our partners ensures that customers can choose the very best options to accelerate their data centers for high utilization and low total cost of ownership.”

The first GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the A100 can boost performance by up to 20x over its predecessor — making it the company’s largest leap in GPU performance to date. It features several technical breakthroughs, including a new multi-instance GPU technology enabling a single A100 to be partitioned into as many as seven separate GPUs to handle varying compute jobs; third-generation NVIDIA® NVLink® technology that makes it possible to join several GPUs together to operate as one giant GPU; and new structural sparsity capabilities that can be used to double a GPU’s performance.

NVIDIA also unveiled a PCIe form factor for the A100, complementing the four- and eight-way NVIDIA HGX™ A100 configurations launched last month. The addition of a PCIe version enables server makers to provide customers with a diverse set of offerings — from single A100 GPU systems to servers featuring 10 or more GPUs. These systems accelerate a wide range of compute-intensive workloads, from simulating molecular behavior for drug discovery to building better financial models for mortgage approvals.

Server manufacturers bringing NVIDIA A100-powered systems to their customers include:

ASUS will offer the ESC4000A-E10, which can be configured with four A100 PCIe GPUs in a single server.

ISC Digital—NVIDIA today unveiled the NVIDIA® Mellanox® UFM® Cyber-AI platform, which minimizes downtime in InfiniBand data centers by harnessing AI-powered analytics to detect security threats and operational issues, as well as predict network failures.

This extension of the UFM platform product portfolio — which has managed InfiniBand systems for nearly a decade — applies AI to learn a data center’s operational cadence and network workload patterns, drawing on both real-time and historic telemetry and workload data. Against this baseline, it tracks the system’s health and network modifications, and detects performance degradations, usage and profile changes.

The new platform provides alerts of abnormal system and application behavior, and potential system failures and threats, as well as performs corrective actions. It is also targeted to deliver security alerts in cases of attempted system hacking to host undesired applications, such as cryptocurrency mining. The result is reduced data center downtime — which typically costs more than $300,000 an hour, according to research by ITIC.(1)

“The UFM Cyber-AI platform determines a data center’s unique vital signs and uses them to identify performance degradation, component failures and abnormal usage patterns,” said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of marketing for Mellanox networking at NVIDIA. “It allows system administrators to quickly detect and respond to potential security threats and address upcoming failures, saving cost and ensuring consistent service to customers.”

Ecosystem Support

Organizations that have long been employing the UFM platform in their data centers have expressed strong interest in the latest offering.

Allan Williams, associate director of services and technology at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI Australia), said: “NCI plays a pivotal role in the national research landscape. Our supercomputing infrastructure serves 5,000 researchers who use it for critical national and global activities. UFM enables us to effectively manage our supercomputers and to optimize performance. We look forward to utilizing the new capabilities of UFM Cyber-AI to enhance even further our supercomputing utilization and improve our return on investment.”

Douglas Johnson, associate director of the Ohio Supercomputer Center, said: “We have been using the UFM platform for years in our InfiniBand data centers. UFM and the expertise from the Mellanox networking team have been fundamental ingredients in the management of our network and the stability we’ve achieved. We see great advantages in the UFM Cyber-AI platform.”

Extending UFM Platform

The UFM Cyber-AI platform complements the UFM Enterprise platform, which provides network monitoring, management, performance optimization, configuration checks and secure cable management.

NVIDIA also added today a third member of the UFM family, the UFM Telemetry platform. This tool captures real-time network telemetry data, which is streamed to an on-premises or cloud-based database to monitor network performance and validate the network configuration.

NVIDIA today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 26, 2020, of $3.08 billion, up 39 percent from $2.22 billion a year earlier, and down 1 percent from $3.11 billion in the previous quarter.

GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.47, up 130 percent from $0.64 a year ago, and down 4 percent from $1.53 in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.80, up 105 percent from $0.88 a year earlier, and down 5 percent from $1.89 in the previous quarter.

NVIDIA completed its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. on April 27, 2020, for a transaction value of $7 billion. It also transitioned its GPU Technology Conference to an all-digital format, drawing more than 55,000 registered participants, while NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote videos were viewed 3.8 million times in their first three days.

“As the world battles COVID-19, we salute the first responders, healthcare workers, and service workers who courageously step in harm’s way to save lives and keep the world going,” Huang said. “We also thank the scientists around the world racing to find a vaccine for COVID-19.

“NVIDIA had an excellent quarter. The acquisition of Mellanox expands our cloud and data center opportunity. We raised the bar for AI computing with the launch and shipment of our Ampere GPU. And our digital GTC conference attracted a record number of developers, highlighting the accelerating adoption of NVIDIA GPU computing.

“Our Data Center business achieved a record and its first $1 billion quarter. NVIDIA is well positioned to advance the most powerful technology forces of our time – cloud computing and AI,” he said.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, NVIDIA paid dividends of $98 million. Due to current market uncertainties, NVIDIA is evaluating the timing of resuming share repurchases and will remain nimble based on market conditions. NVIDIA is currently authorized to repurchase up to $7.24 billion in shares through December 2022. It remains committed to paying its quarterly dividend.

Q1 Fiscal 2021 Summary

GAAP ($ in millions, except earnings per share) Q1 FY21 Q4 FY20 Q1 FY20 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $3,080 $3,105 $2,220 Down 1% Up 39% Gross margin 65.1% 64.9% 58.4% Up 20 bps Up 670 bps Operating expenses $1,028 $1,025 $938 -- Up 10% Operating income $976 $990 $358 Down 1% Up 173% Net income $917 $950 $394 Down 3% Up 133% Diluted earnings per share $1.47 $1.53 $0.64 Down 4% Up 130%

Non-GAAP ($ in millions, except earnings per share) Q1 FY21 Q4 FY20 Q1 FY20 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $3,080 $3,105 $2,220 Down 1% Up 39% Gross margin 65.8% 65.4% 59.0% Up 40 bps Up 680 bps Operating expenses $821 $810 $753 Up 1% Up 9% Operating income $1,205 $1,220 $557 Down 1% Up 116% Net income $1,120 $1,172 $543 Down 4% Up 106% Diluted earnings per share $1.80 $1.89 $0.88 Down 5% Up 105%

NVIDIA’s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 includes the impact from the acquisition of Mellanox, which closed on the first day of the second quarter. The combined second quarter outlook is as follows:

Revenue is expected to be $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2 percent. Mellanox is expected to contribute a low-teens percentage of combined second quarter revenue.

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6 percent and 66.0 percent, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are non-recurring in nature.

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion and $1.04 billion, respectively. The sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year, which will include Mellanox starting with the second quarter, are expected at approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million and $45 million, respectively.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, excluding any discrete items. GAAP discrete items include excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, which are expected to generate variability on a quarter by quarter basis.

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income net, non-GAAP other expense net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, legal settlement costs, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

GTC 2020 -- NVIDIA today announced the release of NVIDIA Jarvis , a GPU-accelerated application framework that allows companies to use video and speech data to build state-of-the-art conversational AI services customized for their own industry, products and customers.

The shift toward working from home, telemedicine and remote learning has created a surge in demand for custom, language-based AI services, ranging from customer support to real-time transcriptions and summarization of video calls to keep people productive and connected.

Among the first companies to take advantage of Jarvis-based conversational AI products and services for their customers are Voca, an AI agent for call center support; Kensho, for automatic speech transcriptions for finance and business; and Square, with its virtual assistant for appointment scheduling.

“Conversational AI is central to the future of many industries, as applications gain the ability to understand and communicate with nuance and contextual awareness,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Jarvis can help the healthcare, financial services, education and retail industries automate their overloaded customer support with speed and accuracy.”

Applications built with Jarvis can take advantage of innovations in the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU for AI computing and the latest optimizations in NVIDIA TensorRT™ for inference. For the first time, it’s now possible to run an entire multimodal application, using the most powerful vision and speech models, faster than the 300-millisecond threshold for real-time interactions.

Jarvis provides a complete, GPU-accelerated software stack and tools making it easy for developers to create, deploy and run end-to-end, real-time conversational AI applications that can understand terminology unique to each company and its customers.

“IDC continues to see rapid growth within the conversational AI market largely because organizations of all sizes are beginning to realize the value of using well-trained virtual assistants and chatbots to help service their customers and grow their businesses,” said David Schubmehl, research director of AI Software Platforms at IDC. “IDC expects worldwide spending on conversational AI use cases like automated customer service agents and digital assistants to grow from $5.8 billion in 2019 to $13.8 billion in 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent.”

To offer an interactive, personalized experience, companies need to train their language-based applications on data that is specific to their own product offerings and customer requirements. However, building a service from scratch requires deep AI expertise, large amounts of data and compute resources to train the models, and software to regularly update models with new data.

Jarvis addresses these challenges by offering an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for conversational AI. It includes state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as NVIDIA’s Megatron BERT for natural language understanding. Enterprises can further fine-tune these models on their data using NVIDIA NeMo , optimize for inference using TensorRT, and deploy in the cloud and at the edge using Helm charts available on NGC , NVIDIA’s catalog of GPU-optimized software.

Early Adopters — Voca, Kensho, Square

Companies worldwide are using NVIDIA’s conversational AI platform to improve their services.

Voca’s AI virtual agents — which use NVIDIA for faster, more interactive, human-like engagements — are used by Toshiba, AT&T and other world-leading companies. Voca uses AI to understand the full intent of a customer’s spoken conversation and speech. This makes it possible for the agents to automatically identify different tones and vocal clues to discern between what a customer says and what a customer means. Additionally, using scalability features built into NVIDIA’s AI platform, they can dramatically reduce customer wait time.

“Low latency is critical in call centers and with NVIDIA GPUs our agents are able to listen, understand and respond in under a second with the highest levels of accuracy,” said Alan Bekker, co-founder and CTO of Voca. “Now our virtual agents are able to successfully handle 70-80 percent of all calls — ranging from general customer service requests to payment transactions and technical support.”

Kensho, the innovation hub for S&P Global located in Cambridge, Mass., that deploys scalable machine learning and analytics systems, has used NVIDIA’s conversational AI to develop Scribe , a speech recognition solution for finance and business. With NVIDIA, Scribe outperforms other commercial solutions on earnings calls and similar financial audio in terms of accuracy by a margin of up to 20 percent.

“We’re working closely with NVIDIA on ways to push end-to-end automatic speech recognition with deep learning even further,” said Georg Kucsko, head of AI research at Kensho. “By training new models with NVIDIA, we’re able to offer higher transcription accuracy for financial jargon compared to traditional approaches that do not use AI, offering our customers timely information in minutes versus days.”

Square has created an AI virtual assistant that allows Square sellers to use AI to automatically confirm, cancel or change appointments with their customers, and free themselves to conduct more strategic customer engagement.

“Square Assistant can understand and provide help for 75 percent of customer questions, along with ensuring that 10 percent more people are showing up to their appointments,” said Gabor Angeli, head of conversational AI at Square. “With GPUs, we’re able to train models 10x faster versus CPUs to deliver more accurate, human-like interactions, ultimately helping our customers grow their businesses.”

GTC 2020 -- BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA Isaac™ robotics platform to enhance its automotive factories — utilizing logistics robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies, the companies announced today.

The collaboration centers on implementing an end-to-end system based on NVIDIA technologies — from training and testing through to deployment — with robots developed using one software architecture, running on NVIDIA’s open Isaac robotics platform. BMW Group’s objective is to enhance logistics factory flow to produce custom-configured cars more rapidly and efficiently. Once developed, the system will be deployed to BMW Group factories worldwide.

“BMW Group’s use of NVIDIA’s Isaac robotics platform to reimagine their factory is revolutionary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “BMW Group is leading the way to the era of robotic factories, harnessing breakthroughs in AI and robotics technologies to create the next level of highly customizable, just-in-time, just-in-sequence manufacturing.”

“BMW is committed to the Power of Choice for our customers — customization of diverse features across diverse vehicles for diverse customers,” said Jürgen Maidl, senior vice president of Logistics for the BMW Group. “Manufacturing high-quality, highly customized cars, on multiple models, with higher volume, on one factory line requires advanced computing solutions from end-to-end. Our collaboration with NVIDIA allows us to develop the future of factory logistics today and to ultimately delight BMW Group customers worldwide.”

The collaboration uses NVIDIA DGX™ AI systems and Isaac simulation technology to train and test the robots; NVIDIA Quadro® ray-tracing GPUs to render synthetic machine parts to enhance the training; and a new lineup of multiple AI-enabled robots built on the Isaac software development kit, powered by high-performance NVIDIA Jetson ™ and EGX ™ edge computers.

BMW Group’s supply chain takes millions of parts flowing into a factory from more than 4,500 supplier sites, involving 230,000 unique part numbers, and in growing volumes as BMW Group’s car sales have doubled over the past 10 years to 2.5 million vehicles. Moreover, BMW Group vehicles are offered to customers with an average of 100 different options, resulting in 99 percent of customer orders being uniquely different for each other. This creates an immense challenge for factory logistics.

To optimize the enormous complexity of this material flow, autonomous AI-powered logistics robots now assist the current production process in order to assemble highly customized vehicles on the same production line.

“Ultimately, the sheer volume of possible configurations became a challenge to BMW Group production in three fundamental areas – computing, logistics planning, and data analysis,” Maidl said.

BMW Group’s response is to use NVIDIA’s Isaac robotics platform to develop five AI-enabled robots to improve their logistics workflow, powered by a variety of NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier ™ and EGX edge computers. These include both navigation robots to transport material autonomously, as well as manipulation robots to select and organize parts.

Developed on the NVIDIA Isaac SDK , the robots utilize a number of powerful deep neural networks, addressing perception, segmentation, pose estimation and human pose estimation to perceive their environment, detect objects, navigate autonomously and move objects. These robots are trained both on real and synthetic data using NVIDIA GPUs to render ray-traced machine parts in a variety of lighting and occlusion conditions to augment real data.

The real and synthetic data are then used to train deep neural networks on NVIDIA DGX systems. The robots are then continuously tested in NVIDIA’s Isaac Simulators for both navigation and manipulation, operating on NVIDIA’s Omniverse platform, where multiple BMW Group personnel in different geographies can all work in one simulated environment.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce12f2cfac2509d737bab_BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim/BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim_31f01648-257d-4908-8054-db39ede581ed-prv.png,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce1462cfac2778373ae33_STR-Isaac-Sim-dolly/STR-Isaac-Sim-dolly_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce1402cfac2509d737bd5_NVIDIA-Isaac-robotics-platform-working-in-sync/NVIDIA-Isaac-robotics-platform-working-in-sync_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce12f2cfac2509d737bab_BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim/BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim_31f01648-257d-4908-8054-db39ede581ed-prv.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce1462cfac2778373ae33_STR-Isaac-Sim-dolly/STR-Isaac-Sim-dolly_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce12f2cfac2509d737bab_BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim/BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim_s.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce1402cfac2509d737bd5_NVIDIA-Isaac-robotics-platform-working-in-sync/NVIDIA-Isaac-robotics-platform-working-in-sync_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20204/5ebce12f2cfac2509d737bab_BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim/BMW-STR-Isaac-Sim_mid.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg'}"

“The fusion of IoT and AI has launched the ‘smart everything’ revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Large industries can now offer intelligent connected products and services like the phone industry has with the smartphone. NVIDIA’s EGX Edge AI platform transforms a standard server into a mini, cloud-native, secure, AI data center. With our AI application frameworks, companies can build AI services ranging from smart retail to robotic factories to automated call centers.”

EGX A100 Powered by NVIDIA Ampere Architecture

The EGX A100 is the first edge AI product based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture . As AI moves increasingly to the edge, organizations can include EGX A100 in their servers to carry out real-time processing and protection of the massive amounts of streaming data from edge sensors.

It combines the groundbreaking computing performance of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture with the accelerated networking and critical security capabilities of the NVIDIA Mellanox® ConnectX®-6 Dx SmartNIC to transform standard and purpose-built edge servers into secure, cloud-native AI supercomputers.

The NVIDIA Ampere architecture — the company’s eighth-generation GPU architecture — delivers the largest-ever generational leap in performance for a wide range of compute-intensive workloads, including AI inference and 5G applications running at the edge. This allows the EGX A100 to process high-volume streaming data in real time from cameras and other IoT sensors to drive faster insights and higher business efficiency.

“Data, AI and intelligent cloud-native applications are transforming the enterprise edge in every industry,” said Chris Wright, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Red Hat. “NVIDIA’s new EGX A100 converged accelerators combined with precompiled drivers for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and certified operators for Red Hat OpenShift simplify deployment and management of the hardware and help our joint customers address some of the most demanding AI, edge and 5G workloads.”

With an NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX-6 Dx network card onboard, the EGX A100 can receive up to 200 Gbps of data and send it directly to the GPU memory for AI or 5G signal processing. With the introduction of NVIDIA Mellanox’s time-triggered transport technology for telco ( 5T for 5G ), EGX A100 is a cloud-native, software-defined accelerator that can handle the most latency-sensitive use cases for 5G. This provides the ultimate AI and 5G platform for making intelligent real-time decisions at the points of action — stores, hospitals and factory floors .

“We’ve been collaborating with NVIDIA to build Mavenir’s high-performance virtualized 5G radio access network and accelerated 5G packet core network,” said Pardeep Kohli, president and CEO of Mavenir. “This will enable us to deliver a wide range of new GPU-accelerated 5G services from AI/ML to AR/VR applications.”

Small But Mighty EGX Jetson Xavier NX

The EGX Jetson Xavier NX is the world’s smallest, most powerful AI supercomputer for microservers and edge AIoT boxes, with more than 20 solutions now available from ecosystem partners. It packs the power of an NVIDIA Xavier SoC into a credit card-size module. EGX Jetson Xavier NX, running the EGX cloud-native software stack, can quickly process streaming data from multiple high-resolution sensors.

The energy-efficient module delivers up to 21 TOPS at 15W, or 14 TOPS at 10W. As a result, EGX Jetson Xavier NX opens the door for embedded edge-computing devices that demand increased performance to support AI workloads but are constrained by size, weight, power budget or cost.

“NVIDIA Jetson and NVIDIA EGX are helping us transform retail, making the self-checkout experience quicker and more secure,” said Matt Scott, cofounder and CEO of Malong Technologies. “Through the power of AI, via our RetailAI suite of offerings, it is now possible to accurately recognize hundreds of thousands of products in real time to create more seamless and protected shopping experiences, easily deployable at large scale.

GTC 2020 -- NVIDIA today announced that it is collaborating with the open-source community to bring end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark 3.0, an analytics engine for big data processing used by more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide.

With the anticipated late spring release of Spark 3.0, data scientists and machine learning engineers will for the first time be able to apply revolutionary GPU acceleration to the ETL (extract, transform and load) data processing workloads widely conducted using SQL database operations.

In another first, AI model training will be able to be processed on the same Spark cluster, instead of running the workloads as separate processes on separate infrastructure. This enables high-performance data analytics across the entire data science pipeline, accelerating tens to thousands of terabytes of data from data lake to model training, without changes to existing code used for Spark applications running on premises and in the cloud.

“Data analytics is the greatest high performance computing challenge facing today’s enterprises and researchers,” said Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. “Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark 3.0 pipeline — from ETL to training to inference — delivers the performance and scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI.”

Building on its strategic AI partnership with NVIDIA , Adobe is one of the first companies working with a preview release of Spark 3.0 running on Databricks. It has achieved a 7x performance improvement and 90 percent cost savings in an initial test, using GPU-accelerated data analytics for product development in Adobe Experience Cloud and supporting features that power digital businesses.

The performance gains in Spark 3.0 enhance model accuracy by enabling scientists to train models with larger datasets and retrain models more frequently. This makes it possible to process terabytes of new data every day, which is critical for data scientists supporting online recommender systems or analyzing new research data. In addition, faster processing means that fewer hardware resources are needed to deliver results, providing significant cost savings.

“We’re seeing significantly faster performance with NVIDIA-accelerated Spark 3.0 compared to running Spark on CPUs,” said William Yan, senior director of Machine Learning at Adobe. “With these game-changing GPU performance gains, entirely new possibilities open up for enhancing AI-driven features in our full suite of Adobe Experience Cloud apps.”

NVIDIA Clara Guardian for smart hospitals — Launched today, NVIDIA Clara Guardian™ uses intelligent video analytics and automatic speech recognition technologies so a new generation of smart hospitals can perform vital sign monitoring while limiting staff exposure.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has supercharged the collaboration of technology, research and the healthcare industry to develop new computing solutions that accelerate the understanding of the spread, scale and severity of this disease,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of Healthcare at NVIDIA. “Never before has there been such a critical need to apply the best AI technology and accelerated computing to every facet of healthcare, and its effects will be felt widely beyond this pandemic and across healthcare going forward.”

Genomics Pipelines at the Speed of Light

Running on just-announced NVIDIA A100 GPUs , NVIDIA Clara Parabricks achieved a record for DNA sequencing analysis of the whole genome — slashing analysis time to just under 20 minutes. NVIDIA also introduced GPU-accelerated RNA-sequencing pipelines that return results in less than 2 hours, giving researchers critical insights into patient susceptibility to disease, its progression, and response to treatment.

“Time is critical in the work we do. NVIDIA Clara Parabricks is being leveraged by researchers in the Center for Rare Childhood Disorders to help determine the most effective therapy for each patient and achieve our goal of delivering same-day results,” said Glen Otero, vice president of Scientific Computing at Translational Genomics Research Institute.

Accelerating genomics analysis makes way for creating larger, high-quality datasets in genomics. A newly announced population genome program by Abu Dhabi’s Department of Health is using the Group 42 Artemis supercomputer powered by NVIDIA DGX™ systems and NVIDIA Clara Parabricks to build a representative reference genome specific to UAE citizens and incorporate genomics analysis into a comprehensive program for improved clinical care.

To make it easier for users to benefit from NVIDIA Clara Parabricks acceleration on the cloud, NVIDIA is partnering with the DNAnexus enterprise genomics cloud platform to seamlessly provision, run and return results.

New AI Models to Help Detect COVID-19

Providing researchers an additional tool in the battle against COVID-19, NVIDIA released a set of AI models that can help researchers detect and study infected patients through chest CT scan data.

The models are immediately available in the latest release of Clara Imaging on the NGC ™ software catalog.

Jointly developed by NVIDIA’s applied research team and clinicians and data scientists at the NIH through a cooperative research and development agreement, the models used data from locations with high rates of COVID-19 infections, including China, Italy, Japan and the United States.

The AI models were built using the NVIDIA Clara application framework for medical imaging. NVIDIA Clara contains domain-specific AI training and deployment workflow tools that allowed NVIDIA and NIH to develop the models in under three weeks.

Building robust AI models is a global priority but sharing data is still challenging across global borders. Now underway is a new multinational COVID-19 federated learning initiative led by NVIDIA and Mass General Brigham to expand COVID-19 AI models to X-ray imaging that enables local adaptation without sharing any patient data and protecting patient privacy.

NVIDIA Clara Guardian Helps Hospitals on the Frontline

The new NVIDIA Clara Guardian application framework enables a critically needed ecosystem of AI solutions for hospital public safety and patient monitoring by transforming everyday sensors into smart sensors.

Minecraft with RTX moves to open beta this week and introduces real-time ray tracing and DLSS 2.0 to the best-selling videogame of all time.

Millions of Minecraft gamers across the globe will get to experience their self-created worlds more vividly than ever before when Minecraft with RTX moves to open beta on Windows 10 this week and introduces realistic shadows, lighting and vibrant colors to the best-selling videogame of all time.

“We teamed up with Mojang Studios to bring next-generation ray tracing and AI to Minecraft and the results are truly amazing,” said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of gaming at NVIDIA. “There is a ton of excitement from the community for Minecraft with RTX, and we can’t wait to see what they create.”

On Thursday, at 10 a.m. Pacific time, Minecraft players on Windows 10 can download the beta of the highly anticipated free game update, unleashing a next-generation graphical makeover that includes real-time ray tracing, more realistic materials and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 .

NVIDIA will also give players six new Minecraft worlds to download for free from the Minecraft Marketplace, allowing them to experience what is possible in Minecraft when real-time ray tracing is applied.

“The next big evolution for Minecraft has arrived with Minecraft with RTX,” said Saxs Persson, franchise creative director of Minecraft at Microsoft. “The core of regular Minecraft is building with blocks. GeForce RTX GPUs transform the Minecraft world with a dramatically more realistic look by adding life-like lighting effects, shadows, reflections, refraction and more to the builder’s tool kit.”

Ray Tracing Comes to Minecraft

Together, NVIDIA, Microsoft and Mojang Studios, the developer of Minecraft, have added a form of ray tracing known as path tracing for the Windows 10 version of the game. Path tracing simulates the way light is transported throughout a scene. It presents a unified model for lighting calculations for many different types of effects that have traditionally been implemented separately using rasterized or hybrid renderers. Among these are:

Direct lighting from the sun, sky and various light sources

Realistic hard and soft shadows

Emissive lighting from surfaces such as glowstone and lava

Global illumination

Accurate reflections in water and metallic surfaces

Transparent materials such as stained glass, water and ice with reflection and refraction

Volumetric fog and light shafts

Ray tracing was added to Minecraft using the industry-standard Microsoft DirectX 12 Ultimate API. NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs are the only GPUs with dedicated ray-tracing cores that allow games to be ray traced in real time.

New Physically Based Materials System

Building blocks in Minecraft are now upgraded with material properties that emulate real life — a technique known as physically based rendering (PBR). This PBR system supports material properties for light emission, roughness, depth and metallicity that combine with ray tracing to enable lighting effects such as reflections, refraction, translucency, transparency and global illumination that open new possibilities and ways to create in Minecraft.

Using AI to Boost Image Quality in Minecraft

Minecraft with RTX also introduces NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 to the game. Powered by RTX Tensor Cores, DLSS 2.0 is an improved deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games. It provides the performance headroom — 1.7x+ faster frame rates — to power full path tracing in Minecraft with RTX.

Six Gorgeous New Minecraft Worlds to Play in, Build and Explore

To celebrate the open beta of Minecraft with RTX, NVIDIA has worked with some of the most talented Minecraft creators to make six new Minecraft worlds available to gamers that show off the dramatic possibilities that ray tracing and PBR textures bring to the game. Selected due to their fantastic track record of making captivating contributions in the Minecraft community, these creators delivered exciting results.

“What Minecraft with RTX introduces to the game can only be described as mind-blowing,” said RazzleberryFox, CEO at Razzleberries , a founding partner and industry leader on the Minecraft Marketplace. “The added dimension these incredible visuals add to Minecraft has reinvigorated our collective creativity and enabled us to create amazing new worlds and experiences for Minecraft that just were not possible before.”

The six new worlds will be downloadable for free from the in-game Minecraft Marketplace and include:

Aquatic Adventure RTX by Dr_Bond

Color, Light and Shadow RTX by PearlescentMoon

Crystal Palace RTX by GeminiTay

Imagination Island RTX by BlockWorks

Neon District RTX by Elysium Fire

Of Temples and Totems RTX by Razzleberries

NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. Discussions with China’s regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing, and NVIDIA believes the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020.

While the ultimate effect of the coronavirus is difficult to estimate, the company has reduced its revenue outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 by $100 million to account for its potential impact.

Revenue is expected to be $3.00 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.0 percent and 65.4 percent, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million, respectively.

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, excluding any discrete items. GAAP discrete items include excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, which are expected to generate variability on a quarter by quarter basis.

Highlights

Since the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, NVIDIA has achieved progress in these areas:

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx .

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today introduced groundbreaking inference software that developers everywhere can use to deliver conversational AI applications, slashing inference latency that until now has impeded true, interactive engagement.

NVIDIA TensorRT™ 7 — the seventh generation of the company’s inference software development kit — opens the door to smarter human-to-AI interactions, enabling real-time engagement with applications such as voice agents, chatbots and recommendation engines.

It is estimated that there are 3.25 billion digital voice assistants being used in devices around the world, according to Juniper Research . By 2023, that number is expected to reach 8 billion, more than the world’s total population.

TensorRT 7 features a new deep learning compiler designed to automatically optimize and accelerate the increasingly complex recurrent and transformer-based neural networks needed for AI speech applications. This speeds the components of conversational AI by more than 10x compared to when run on CPUs, driving latency below the 300-millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions.

“We have entered a new chapter in AI, where machines are capable of understanding human language in real time,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang at his GTC China keynote. “TensorRT 7 helps make this possible, providing developers everywhere with the tools to build and deploy faster, smarter conversational AI services that allow more natural human-to-AI interaction.”

Some of the world’s largest, most innovative companies are already taking advantage of NVIDIA’s conversational AI acceleration capabilities. Among these is Sogou, which provides search services to WeChat, the world’s most frequently used application on mobile phones.

“Sogou provides high-quality AI services, such as voice, image, translation, dialogue and Q&A to hundreds of millions of users every day,” said Yang Hongtao, CTO of Sogou. “By using the NVIDIA TensorRT inference platform, we enable online service responses in real time. These leading AI capabilities have significantly improved our user experience.”

Rising Importance of Recurrent Neural Networks

TensorRT 7 speeds up a growing universe of AI models that are being used to make predictions on time-series, sequence-data scenarios that use recurrent loop structures, called RNNs. In addition to being used for conversational AI speech networks, RNNs help with arrival time planning for cars or satellites, prediction of events in electronic medical records, financial asset forecasting and fraud detection.

An explosion of combinations for RNN configurations and functions has created a challenge to rapidly deploy production code that meets real-time performance criteria — causing months-long delays while developers created hand-written code optimizations. As a result, conversational AI has been limited to the few companies with the necessary talent.

With TensorRT’s new deep learning compiler, developers everywhere now have the ability to automatically optimize these networks — such as bespoke automatic speech recognition networks, and WaveRNN and Tacotron 2 for text-to-speech — and to deliver the best possible performance and lowest latencies.

The new compiler also optimizes transformer-based models like BERT for natural language processing.

Accelerating Inference from Edge to Cloud

TensorRT 7 can rapidly optimize, validate and deploy a trained neural network for inference by hyperscale data centers, embedded or automotive GPU platforms.

NVIDIA’s inference platform — which includes TensorRT, as well as several NVIDIA CUDA-X AI™ libraries and NVIDIA GPUs — delivers low-latency, high-throughput inference for applications beyond conversational AI, including image classification, fraud detection, segmentation, object detection and recommendation engines. Its capabilities are widely used by some of the world’s leading enterprise and consumer technology companies, including Alibaba, American Express, Baidu, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap, Tencent and Twitter.",http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

NVIDIA today announced that it will provide the transportation industry with access to its NVIDIA DRIVE ™ deep neural networks (DNNs) for autonomous vehicle development on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) container registry.

NVIDIA DRIVE has become a de facto standard for AV development, used broadly by automakers, truck manufacturers, robotaxi companies, software companies and universities. Now, NVIDIA is providing access of its pre-trained AI models and training code to AV developers. Using a suite of NVIDIA AI tools, the ecosystem can freely extend and customize the models to increase the robustness and capabilities of their self-driving systems.

“The AI autonomous vehicle is a software-defined vehicle required to operate around the world on a wide variety of datasets,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By providing AV developers access to our DNNs and the advanced learning tools to optimize them for multiple datasets, we’re enabling shared learning across companies and countries, while maintaining data ownership and privacy. Ultimately, we are accelerating the reality of global autonomous vehicles.”

AI is central to the development of safe, self-driving cars — allowing them to perceive and react in real time to their surroundings for intelligent operation. At its core are dozens of DNNs that tackle redundant and diverse tasks, ensuring accurate perception, localization and path planning.

“NVIDIA leads the world in developing the deepest and broadest suite of DNNs and AI tools for the transportation industry,” said Luca De Ambroggi, senior research director of Artificial Intelligence at IHS Markit. “Making these algorithms available to others, along with the tools and workflow infrastructure to customize them, will help enable the deployment of safe autonomous transportation.”

NVIDIA has spent years developing and training DNNs that run on the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX™ platform , turning raw sensor data into a deep understanding of the world. These DNNs cover such tasks as traffic-light and sign detection, object detection (for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles) and path perception, as well as gaze detection and gesture recognition inside the vehicle.

Advanced Learning Tools for AI Development:

In addition to providing access to the DNNs, NVIDIA announced the availability of a suite of advanced tools so developers can customize and enhance NVIDIA’s DNNs using their own datasets and target feature set. These tools allow the training of DNNs using active learning, federated learning and transfer learning:

Active learning improves model accuracy and reduces data collection costs by automating data selection using AI, rather than manual curation.

Federated learning enables companies to utilize datasets across countries and with other companies while maintaining data privacy and protecting their intellectual property.

enables companies to utilize datasets across countries and with other companies while maintaining data privacy and protecting their intellectual property. Transfer learning gives DRIVE customers the ability to speed development of their perception software by leveraging NVIDIA’s significant investment in AV development, then further developing these networks for their own applications and target capability.

NVIDIA today introduced Jetson Xavier™ NX , the world’s smallest, most powerful AI supercomputer for robotic and embedded computing devices at the edge.

With a compact form factor smaller than the size of a credit card, the energy-efficient Jetson Xavier NX module delivers server-class performance up to 21 TOPS for running modern AI workloads, and consumes as little as 10 watts of power.

Jetson Xavier NX opens the door for embedded edge computing devices that demand increased performance but are constrained by size, weight, power budgets or cost. These include small commercial robots, drones, intelligent high-resolution sensors for factory logistics and production lines, optical inspection, network video recorders, portable medical devices and other industrial IoT systems.

“AI has become the enabling technology for modern robotics and embedded devices that will transform industries,” said Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “Many of these devices, based on small form factors and lower power, were constrained from adding more AI features. Jetson Xavier NX lets our customers and partners dramatically increase AI capabilities without increasing the size or power consumption of the device.”

Jetson Xavier NX delivers up to 14 TOPS (at 10W) or 21 TOPS (at 15W), running multiple neural networks in parallel and processing data from multiple high-resolution sensors simultaneously in a Nano form factor (70x45mm). For companies already building embedded machines, Jetson Xavier NX runs on the same CUDA-X AI ™ software architecture as all Jetson offerings, ensuring rapid time to market and low development costs.

As part of NVIDIA’s one software architecture approach, Jetson Xavier NX is supported by NVIDIA JetPack™ software development kit , which is a complete AI software stack that can run modern and complex AI networks, accelerated libraries for deep learning as well as computer vision, computer graphics, multimedia and more.

Ecosystem Support

Jetson Xavier NX is receiving strong support from the robotics and embedded devices ecosystem.

“NVIDIA’s embedded Jetson products have been accelerating the research, development and deployment of embedded AI solutions on Lockheed Martin’s platforms,” said Lee Ritholtz, director and chief architect of Applied Artificial Intelligence at Lockheed Martin. “With Jetson Xavier NX’s exceptional performance, small form factor and low power, we will be able to do more processing in real time at the edge than ever before.”

“Our goal is to dramatically increase the quality and accuracy of our optical inspection system and accelerate our move towards industry 4.0,” said Otsuka Hiroshi, CEO of Musashi Seimitsu. “NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX gives us the compute capabilities to improve our visual inspection capabilities without increasing the size and power of our optical inspection system.”

NVIDIA also announced today that it topped all five benchmarks measuring the performance of AI inference workloads in data centers and at the edge — building on the company’s equally strong position in recent benchmarks measuring AI training. The results of MLPerf Inference 0.5, the industry’s first independent AI benchmark for inference, demonstrate the inference capabilities of NVIDIA Turing™ GPUs for data centers and the NVIDIA Xavier™ system-on-a-chip for edge. The Jetson Xavier NX module is built around a new low-power version of the Xavier SoC used in these benchmarks.

“In a world where AI chips are announced on what seems like a daily basis, I believe NVIDIA raised the bar with its Jetson Xavier NX — showing that exceptional performance at small size and low power, together with a consistent and powerful software architecture, is what matters in embedded edge computing,” said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy.

Mobile World Congress -- NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform – a high-performance, cloud-native platform that lets organizations harness rapidly streaming data from factory floors, manufacturing inspection lines and city streets to securely deliver next-generation AI, IoT and 5G-based services at scale, with low latency.

Early adopters of the platform – which combines NVIDIA CUDA-X™ software with NVIDIA-certified GPU servers and devices – include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics and NTT East, as well as the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas.

“We’ve entered a new era, where billions of always-on IoT sensors will be connected by 5G and processed by AI,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, at a keynote at the start of MWC Los Angeles. “Its foundation requires a new class of highly secure, networked computers operated with ease from far away.

“We’ve created the NVIDIA EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform for this world, where computing moves beyond personal and beyond the cloud to operate at planetary scale,” he said.

The EGX platform features software to support a wide range of applications, including NVIDIA Metropolis , which can be used to build smart cities and intelligent video analytics applications, as well as the just-announced NVIDIA Aerial™ software developer kit . Aerial allows telcos to build completely virtualized 5G radio access networks that are highly programmable, scalable and energy efficient, and can ultimately enable them to offer new services such as smart factories, AR/VR and cloud gaming.

As also announced today, early ecosystem partners collaborating with NVIDIA include Microsoft , Ericsson and Red Hat .

Global Leaders Turn to EGX for AI at the Edge

Walmart is a pioneer user of EGX, deploying it in its Levittown, New York, Intelligent Retail Lab — a unique, fully operating grocery store where it’s exploring the ways AI can further improve in-store shopping experiences.

Using EGX’s advanced AI and edge capabilities, Walmart is able to compute in real time more than 1.6 terabytes of data generated each second and can use AI to automatically alert associates to restock shelves, open up new checkout lanes, retrieve shopping carts and ensure product freshness in meat and produce departments.

“At Walmart, we’re using AI to define the future of retail and re-think how technology can further enhance how we operate our stores,” said Mike Hanrahan, CEO of Walmart Intelligent Retail Lab. “With NVIDIA’s EGX edge computing platform, Walmart’s Intelligent Retail Lab is able to bring real-time AI compute to our store, automate processes and free up our associates to create a better and more convenient shopping experience for our customers.”

Samsung Electronics, in another early EGX deployment, is using AI at the edge for highly complex semiconductor design and manufacturing processes.

“Samsung has been an early adopter of both GPU computing and AI from the beginning,” said Charlie Bae, executive vice president of foundry sales and marketing at Samsung Electronics. “NVIDIA’s EGX platform helps us to extend these manufacturing and design applications smoothly onto our factory floors.”

Other early EGX deployments include:

BMW — The German automaker is using intelligent video analytics in its South Carolina manufacturing facility to automate inspection. With EGX gathering data from multiple cameras and other sensors in inspection lines, BMW is helping ensure only the highest quality automobiles leave the factory floor.

Gamescom— Minecraft , the world’s best-selling video game with over 176 million copies sold, will be dramatically more realistic through support for real-time ray tracing on PC, NVIDIA and Microsoft today announced.

A free game update will provide Minecraft players with vivid visualizations of their self-created worlds, with more realistic shadows, lighting and vibrant colors.

“Minecraft will expose ray tracing to millions of gamers of all ages and backgrounds that may not play more hardcore video games,” said Matt Wuebbling, head of GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “The world’s best-selling video game adding ray tracing on PC illustrates the momentum that ray tracing has built in the gaming ecosystem.”

“Ray tracing sits at the center of what we think is next for Minecraft,” said Saxs Persson, franchise creative director of Minecraft at Microsoft. “GeForce RTX gives the Minecraft world a brand-new feel to it. In normal Minecraft, a block of gold just appears yellow, but with ray tracing turned on, you really get to see the specular highlight, you get to see the reflection, you can even see a mob reflected in it.”

Together, NVIDIA and Mojang, the developer of the game, are adding a form of ray tracing known as path tracing for the Windows 10 version of the game. Path tracing simulates the way light is transported throughout a scene. It presents a unified model for lighting calculations for many different types of effects that have traditionally been implemented separately using rasterized or hybrid renderers. Among these are:

Direct lighting from the sun, sky and various light sources, including emissive surfaces such as glowstone and lava

Realistic hard and soft shadows depending on the size, shape and distance of the light source

Per-pixel emissive lighting

Indirect diffuse illumination (diffuse global illumination)

Indirect specular illumination (reflections)

Transparent materials with reflection, refraction and scattering (stained glass, water, ice)

Atmospheric scattering and density (volumetric fog, light shafts, realistic sky)

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx .

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2020 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2020.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of our Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SIGGRAPH -- One year after NVIDIA RTX™ technology was unveiled at SIGGRAPH 2018, ray tracing has emerged as the new industry standard for product design, architecture, gaming, effects and scientific visualization.

The world’s leading software makers have introduced over 40 applications with RTX technology, which will enable tens of millions of users to harness ray tracing and AI, which had previously been too computationally demanding for working with interactively. This includes seven applications from top ISVs being introduced this week at SIGGRAPH.

Customers as diverse as Pixar, Renault, New Balance, Woods Bagot and Siemens Healthineers are using ray tracing in their workflows. The gaming industry’s leading engines — Unity and Unreal Engine — support ray tracing with RTX, and RTX technology is integrated by visual computing giants like Adobe, Autodesk, Blackmagic Design and Dassault Systèmes.

“Around the world, designers and artists, OEMs and software providers have embraced real-time ray tracing and AI acceleration as the new industry standard in product design and content creation,” said Greg Estes, vice president of corporate marketing and developer programs at NVIDIA. “From RTX Studio laptops used by millions of creatives to data centers managed by global businesses, the power of NVIDIA RTX can be accessed from anywhere to design better products and produce richer, more immersive entertainment faster than ever.”

Ray tracing calculates each photon of light in a scene as it interacts with materials and surfaces. This provides far more accurate and lifelike images than traditional computer graphics. The NVIDIA RTX platform, which includes software tools and hardware acceleration of ray tracing and AI, enables interactive ray tracing for the first time.

RTX On: Top Applications Take Content Creation to New Heights

RTX allows designers to interactively iterate their product, model or building and see accurate lighting, shadows and reflections. Digital artists in the entertainment field can apply the same principles to their animations and visual effects.

RTX technology can also be used in servers for batch rendering of scenes too complex to visualize in real time, or for “light baking” — pre-calculating how textures will look in certain environments for games and other interactive visualization. And the AI acceleration facilitates denoising, pose estimation and other advanced capabilities that enable new features for animators and visual artists of all kinds.

At SIGGRAPH, seven top ISVs debuted new applications with support for NVIDIA RTX, including:

Adobe Substance Painter : RTX ray tracing accelerates baking performance up to 192x faster than CPUs.

: RTX ray tracing accelerates baking performance up to 192x faster than CPUs. Autodesk Flame : RTX Tensor Cores dramatically accelerate the new machine learning feature set of Autodesk Flame v2020.1.

Luxion KeyShot: RTX accelerated ray tracing and AI denoising for photorealistic visualization of 3D data for product design reviews, marketing, animations, illustrations and more via OptiX support in KeyShot 9.

These complement important applications for design and content creation, which offer their users RTX-powered capabilities and dramatic speed increases.

“For artists, getting different texture maps prepared and baked for 3D painting is time-consuming. RTX-accelerated bakers in Substance Painter deliver up to 192x faster performance than CPU for ambient occlusion and 10-15x overall performance gain when baking all maps,” said Sébastien Deguy, vice president of 3D and Immersive at Adobe. “We believe NVIDIA RTX ray tracing performance is a game-changer, significantly reducing the time for baking, so artists can quickly iterate between modeling and painting, and bring better designs to life faster.”

“Autodesk Flame AI / ML features are accelerated by NVIDIA Quadro GPUs. In Flame v2020.1, the RTX 6000 card offers dramatic acceleration based on dedicated tensor compute cores,” said Steve McNeill, director of product research and development at Autodesk.

Popular apps like Adobe Dimension CC and Chaos Group V-Ray provide users the ability to create fluidly, with incredible realism powered by RTX technology’s RT Cores. Adobe Substance designer can deliver speed increases of up to 800 percent compared with previous CPU-based technology by integrating RTX through DXR for light baking.

The latest version of BlackMagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve with DaVinci Neural Engine is transforming video production with AI by using the NVIDIA AI libraries and Tensor Cores found on NVIDIA RTX GPUs to accelerate inferencing.

“At Chaos, we build our products to take full advantage of the latest hardware to give our customers maximum creative speed,” said Vlado Koylazov, co-founder and CTO at Chaos Group. “Our upcoming RTX acceleration makes this truer than ever, enabling artists to render production scenes far faster with V-Ray GPU and explore their creations in fully ray traced real-time with Project Lavina.”

“Our mission is to share this exciting universe of 3D creation with everyone, as free and open source software. Having NVIDIA actively contributing to this goal is a huge compliment for our work,” said Ton Roosendaal, chairman of Blender Foundation. “As a result, Blender Cycles users can enjoy hardware-accelerated ray tracing on NVIDIA RTX graphics cards.”

It’s On: RTX Everywhere

In under 12 months, RTX has become widely available everywhere. Every major 3D design application in the world has committed to supporting RTX by year’s end. The entire gaming industry is on board with a robust ecosystem that includes support in industry-standard APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan, as well leading game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.

Every major global OEM has unveiled RTX-powered systems. 27 RTX Studio laptops and mobile workstations purpose-built for creative workflows enable desktop-level performance on the go. A new breed of high-performance RTX workstations has revolutionized the work of millions of designers, artists, researchers and scientists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to their workflows.

In the data center, NVIDIA RTX Servers — which include fully optimized software stacks available for OptiX RTX rendering, gaming, VR and AR, and professional visualization applications — deliver cinematic-quality graphics enhanced by RTX ray tracing for far less than the cost of electricity for a CPU-based rendering cluster with the same performance.

NVIDIA today announced breakthroughs in language understanding that allow businesses to engage more naturally with customers using real-time conversational AI.

NVIDIA's AI platform is the first to train one of the most advanced AI language models — BERT — in less than an hour and complete AI inference in just over 2 milliseconds. This groundbreaking level of performance makes it possible for developers to use state-of-the-art language understanding for large-scale applications they can make available to hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide.

Early adopters of NVIDIA's performance advances include Microsoft and some of the world's most innovative startups, which are harnessing NVIDIA's platform to develop highly intuitive, immediately responsive language-based services for their customers.

Limited conversational AI services have existed for several years. But until this point, it has been extremely difficult for chatbots, intelligent personal assistants and search engines to operate with human-level comprehension due to the inability to deploy extremely large AI models in real time. NVIDIA has addressed this problem by adding key optimizations to its AI platform — achieving speed records in AI training and inference and building the largest language model of its kind to date.

""Large language models are revolutionizing AI for natural language,"" said Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA. ""They are helping us solve exceptionally difficult language problems, bringing us closer to the goal of truly conversational AI. NVIDIA's groundbreaking work accelerating these models allows organizations to create new, state-of-the-art services that can assist and delight their customers in ways never before imagined.""

Fastest Training, Fastest Inference, Largest Model

AI services powered by natural language understanding are expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Digital voice assistants alone are anticipated to climb from 2.5 billion to 8 billion within the next four years, according to Juniper Research . Additionally, Gartner predicts, by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions will be completely handled by AI, an increase of 400% from 2017.1

Helping lead this new era, NVIDIA has fine-tuned its AI platform with key optimizations that have resulted in three new natural language understanding performance records:

Fastest training: Running the large version of one of the world's most advanced AI language models — Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) — an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ using 92 NVIDIA DGX-2H™ systems running 1,472 NVIDIA V100 GPUs slashed the typical training time for BERT-Large from several days to just 53 minutes. Additionally, NVIDIA trained BERT-Large on just one NVIDIA DGX-2 system in 2.8 days - demonstrating NVIDIA GPUs' scalability for conversational AI.

Additionally, NVIDIA trained BERT-Large on just one NVIDIA DGX-2 system in 2.8 days - demonstrating NVIDIA GPUs' scalability for conversational AI. Fastest inference: Using NVIDIA T4 GPUs running NVIDIA TensorRT™, NVIDIA performed inference on the BERT-Base SQuAD dataset in only 2.2 milliseconds - well under the 10-millisecond processing threshold for many real-time applications, and a sharp improvement from over 40 milliseconds measured with highly optimized CPU code.

Largest model: With a focus on developers' ever-increasing need for larger models, NVIDIA Research built and trained the world's largest language model based on Transformers, the technology building block used for BERT and a growing number of other natural language AI models. NVIDIA's custom model, with 8.3 billion parameters, is 24 times the size of BERT-Large.

Ecosystem Adoption

Hundreds of developers worldwide are already using NVIDIA's AI platform to advance their own language understanding research and create new services.

Microsoft Bing is using the power of its Azure AI platform and NVIDIA technology to run BERT and drive more accurate search results.

""Microsoft Bing relies on the most advanced AI models and computing platform to deliver the best global search experience possible for our customers,"" said Rangan Majumder, group program manager, Microsoft Bing. ""In close collaboration with NVIDIA, Bing further optimized the inferencing of the popular natural language model BERT using NVIDIA GPUs, part of Azure AI infrastructure, which led to the largest improvement in ranking search quality Bing deployed in the last year. We achieved two times the latency reduction and five times throughput improvement during inference using Azure NVIDIA GPUs compared with a CPU-based platform, enabling Bing to offer a more relevant, cost-effective, real-time search experience for all our customers globally.""

Several startups in NVIDIA's Inception program , including Clinc, Passage AI and Recordsure, are also using NVIDIA's AI platform to build cutting-edge conversational AI services for banks, car manufacturers, retailers, healthcare providers, travel and hospitality companies, and more.

Clinc has made NVIDIA GPU-enabled conversational AI solutions accessible to more than 30 million people globally through a customer roster that includes leading car manufacturers, healthcare organizations and some of the world's leading financial institutions, including Barclays, USAA and Turkey's largest bank, Isbank.

""Clinc's leading AI platform understands complex questions and transforms them into powerful, actionable insights for the world's leading brands,"" said Jason Mars, CEO of Clinc. ""The breakthrough performance that NVIDIA's AI platform provides has allowed us to push the boundaries of conversational AI and deliver revolutionary services that help our customers use technology to engage with their customers in powerful, more meaningful ways.""

Computex -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA EGX , an accelerated computing platform that enables companies to perform low-latency AI at the edge — to perceive, understand and act in real time on continuous streaming data between 5G base stations, warehouses, retail stores, factories and beyond.

NVIDIA EGX was created to meet the growing demand to perform instantaneous, high-throughput AI at the edge — where data is created – with guaranteed response times, while reducing the amount of data that must be sent to the cloud.

By 2025, 150 billion machine sensors and IoT devices will stream continuous data that will need to be processed(1) — orders of magnitude more than produced today by individuals using smartphones. Edge servers like those in the NVIDIA EGX platform will be distributed throughout the world to process data in real time from these sensors.

“Enterprises demand more powerful computing at the edge to process their oceans of raw data — streaming in from countless interactions with customers and facilities — to make rapid, AI-enhanced decisions that can drive their business,” said Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “A scalable platform like NVIDIA EGX allows them to easily deploy systems to meet their needs on premises, in the cloud or both.”

Scalability

EGX starts with the tiny NVIDIA Jetson Nano ™, which in a few watts can provide one-half trillion operations per second (TOPS) of processing for tasks such as image recognition. And it spans all the way to a full rack of NVIDIA T4 servers , delivering more than 10,000 TOPS for real-time speech recognition and other real-time AI tasks.

Enterprise-Grade

NVIDIA has partnered with Red Hat to integrate and optimize NVIDIA Edge Stack with OpenShift, the leading enterprise-grade Kubernetes container orchestration platform.

NVIDIA Edge Stack is optimized software that includes NVIDIA drivers, a CUDA® Kubernetes plugin, a CUDA container runtime, CUDA-X™ libraries and containerized AI frameworks and applications, including TensorRT™, TensorRT Inference Server and DeepStream. NVIDIA Edge Stack is optimized for certified servers and downloadable from the NVIDIA NGC™ registry .

“Red Hat is committed to providing a consistent experience for any workload, footprint and location, from the hybrid cloud to the edge,” said Chris Wright, chief technology officer at Red Hat. “By combining Red Hat OpenShift and NVIDIA EGX-enabled platforms, customers can better optimize their distributed operations with a consistent, high-performance, container-centric environment.”

An “On-Prem AI Cloud-in-a-Box”

EGX combines the full range of NVIDIA AI computing technologies with Red Hat OpenShift and NVIDIA Edge Stack together with Mellanox and Cisco security, networking and storage technologies. This enables companies in the largest industries — telecom, manufacturing, retail, healthcare and transportation — to quickly stand up state-of-the-art, secure, enterprise-grade AI infrastructures.

“Mellanox Smart NICs and switches provide the ideal I/O connectivity for data access that scale from the edge to hyperscale data centers,” said Michael Kagan, chief technology officer at Mellanox Technologies. “The combination of high-performance, low-latency and accelerated networking provides a new infrastructure tier of computing that is critical to efficiently access and supply the data needed to fuel the next generation of advanced AI solutions on edge platforms such as NVIDIA EGX.”

“Cisco is excited to collaborate with NVIDIA to provide edge-to-core full stack solutions for our customers, leveraging Cisco’s EGX-enabled platforms with Cisco compute, fabric, storage, and management software and our leading Ethernet and IP-based networking technologies,” said Kaustubh Das, vice president of Cisco Computing Systems.

Enables Hybrid-Cloud and Multi-Cloud IoT

NVIDIA AI computing is offered by major clouds and is architecturally compatible with NVIDIA EGX. AI applications developed in the cloud can run on NVIDIA EGX and vice versa. NVIDIA Edge Stack connects to major cloud IoT services, and customers can remotely manage their service from AWS IoT Greengrass and Microsoft Azure IoT Edge.

“Azure IoT Edge helps customers deploy cloud service to their IoT devices quickly and securely,” said Sam George, director of Azure IoT Edge. “We look forward to supporting NVIDIA’s EGX edge platform on Azure IoT Edge devices so that customers can deploy AI workloads targeting EGX-compatible hardware.”

Widespread Developer Support

NVIDIA EGX is optimizing AI at the edge for a growing ecosystem of software solutions.

These include video analytics applications, which are ideal for large retail chains and smart cities, from software vendors such as AnyVision, DeepVision, IronYun and Malong Technologies, as well as healthcare-specific software offerings from 12 Sigma, Infervision, Quantib and Subtle Medical.

Adoption by World’s Top Computer Makers

EGX servers are available from global enterprise computing providers ATOS, Cisco, Dell EMC, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur and Lenovo. They are also available from major server and IoT system makers Abaco, Acer, ADLINK, Advantech, ASRock Rack, ASUS, AverMedia, Cloudian, Connect Tech, Curtiss-Wright, GIGABYTE, Leetop, MiiVii, Musashi Seimitsu, QCT, Sugon, Supermicro, Tyan, WiBase and Wiwynn.

Computex -- NVIDIA today announced that Quake II RTX will be available on GeForce.com as a free download on June 6.

Quake II RTX is the world’s first game that is fully path-traced, a ray-tracing technique that unifies all lighting effects such as shadows, reflections, refractions and more into a single ray-tracing algorithm. The result is a stunning new look for id Software’s Quake II, one of the world’s most popular games, originally launched in 1997.

Quake II RTX includes the first three single-player levels of the beloved PC gaming classic. Gamers that already own Quake II can experience the whole game in its entirety, including multiplayer deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes, all fully path traced.

“Quake II RTX is an expression of our love and passion for PC gaming,” said Matt Wuebbling, head of GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “By applying next-generation ray-traced graphics technologies and using the Vulkan API, we are able to share this PC classic with a new generation of gamers who can download and play it for free.”

“It’s rare that a PC game has the impact and longevity of Quake II, and seeing it reimagined with ray tracing 20 years later is something special for me,” said Tim Willits, studio director of id Software and one of the creators of the original Quake franchise. “Equally special is the relationship with NVIDIA, whom we have worked with since the early days of first-person shooters. Seeing how NVIDIA integrated modern features into this classic game is really exciting.”

View the Quake II RTX technology explainer video and a preview of Quake II RTX in all its ray-traced glory in the Quake II RTX trailer . More details are available on GeForce.com .

Same Great Game, Stunning New Look

The visually stunning new look of the classic game is achieved by a ray-tracing technique known as path tracing, which traces light rays (paths) through the scene in a way that unifies all lighting effects into a single ray-traced algorithm. This elegant form of rendering is used in computer graphics in films but has previously been too expensive for games.

The lighting effects in Quake II RTX are so advanced they require hardware support for ray tracing, such as the specialized RT Cores found in the Turing™ architecture and NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs , to run in real time. The minimum specification for running Quake II RTX in real time is a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU.

New levels of realism seen in Quake II RTX include real-time, high-dynamic range time of day lighting, with accurate sun light and indirect illumination. Physically based materials are rendered accurately. For example, water and glass refract light accurately, emissive surfaces get dramatic soft lighting effects, surfaces deliver accurate reflections and light sources illuminate surrounding objects. Weapon model details and textures have also been increased, and an improved denoiser has been added to increase image quality.

Quake II RTX uses NVIDIA VKRay ™, an extension that allows any developer using the Vulkan API to add ray-traced effects to their games. Building on Q2VKPT, a version of the game created by Christoph Schied using the open-sourced Quake II game engine, Quake II RTX is a pure ray-traced game that runs on a Vulkan renderer with support for Linux.

“Quake II RTX demonstrates that the Vulkan API with real-time ray tracing can be used to create stunning gaming experiences using some of the most advanced rendering techniques available to game developers,” said Neil Trevett, president of the Khronos Group and vice president of developer ecosystems at NVIDIA. “And, having Quake II RTX available as a free download makes it accessible to both Windows and Linux gamers everywhere.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201905/5ceb8a89ed6ae52142d5a211_cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10/cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10_8627c643-4505-44b2-9526-45b8d0a8b0eb-prv.jpg,"{'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201905/5ceb8a89ed6ae52142d5a211_cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10/cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201905/5ceb8a89ed6ae52142d5a211_cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10/cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201905/5ceb8a89ed6ae52142d5a211_cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10/cabde649-edf8-4487-bc15-c6f0adcdf10_8627c643-4505-44b2-9526-45b8d0a8b0eb-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

The collaboration is part of King’s London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-Based Healthcare, an ongoing project intended to transform 12 clinical pathways in oncology, cardiology and neurology, as well as improve diagnoses and patient care in the NHS.

The work could lead to breakthroughs in classifying stroke and neurological impairments, determining the underlying causes of cancers and recommending the best treatments for patients.

NVIDIA DGX-2 AI Systems Power First Point-of-Care Platform

King’s is implementing NVIDIA®️ DGX-2™ systems , which are 2-petaflops GPU-powered supercomputers for AI research, as part of the first phase of the project. It will also use the NVIDIA Clara AI toolkit with its own imaging technologies, for example NiftyNet, as well as those from partners such as Kheiron Medical, Mirada and Scan.

The NVIDIA Clara AI toolkit is a key part of the NVIDIA Clara developer platform, on which intelligent workflows can be built. NVIDIA Clara consists of libraries for data and image processing, AI model processing, and visualization.

Researchers and engineers from NVIDIA and King’s will also join clinicians from major London hospitals onsite at King’s College Hospital, Guy’s and St Thomas’, and South London and Maudsley. This combination of research, technology and clinicians will accelerate the discovery of data strategies, resolve targeted AI problems and speed up deployment in clinics.

Federated Learning Supports Data Privacy

For the first time in the NHS, federated learning will be applied to algorithm development, ensuring the privacy of patient data. Federated learning allows AI algorithms to be developed at multiple sites, using data from each individual hospital, without the need for data to travel outside of its own domain.

This approach is crucial for the development of AI in clinical environments, where the security and governance of data is of the highest importance. AI models will be developed in different NHS trusts across the U.K., built on data from different patient demographics and clinical attributes.

With models developed at individual NHS trusts, the data will give more accurate and representative insight into patients from that particular area. The NHS will also be able to combine these trust-specific models to build a larger, demographically richer overall model.

By bringing together a critical mass of industry and university partners, the London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-Based Healthcare will allow the NHS to share and analyze data on a scale that has not previously been possible, according to Professor Sebastien Ourselin, head of the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King’s College London.

“This centre marks a significant chapter in the future of AI-enabled NHS hospitals, and the infrastructure is an essential part of building new AI tools which will benefit patients and the healthcare system as a whole,” said Professor Ourselin. “The NVIDIA DGX-2 AI system’s large memory and massive computing power make it possible for us to tackle training of large, 3D datasets in minutes instead of days while keeping the data secure on the premises of the hospital.”

Jaap Zuiderveld, vice president for EMEA at NVIDIA, said, “Together with King’s College London, we’re working to push the envelope in AI for healthcare. DGX-2 systems with the NVIDIA Clara platform will enable the project to scale and drive breakthroughs in radiology ultimately help improve patient outcomes within the NHS.”

The collaboration between NVIDIA and King’s College London is part of the UKRI program for Radiology and Pathology, an innovation fund that has supported the growing community looking to integrate AI workflows into the NHS.

World Medical Innovation Forum — NVIDIA and the American College of Radiology today announced a collaboration to enable thousands of radiologists nationwide to create and use AI for diagnostic radiology in their own facilities, using their own data, to meet their own clinical needs.

Following a successful three-month pilot program by both parties, ACR is integrating the NVIDIA Clara™ AI toolkit into the newly announced ACR Data Science Institute® ACR AI-LAB ™, a free software platform that will be made available to more than 38,000 ACR members and other radiology professionals to build, share, locally adapt and validate AI algorithms, while also ensuring patient data stays protected at the local institution.

The NVIDIA Clara AI toolkit is a key part of the NVIDIA Clara developer platform, which is designed to enable software-defined medical instruments and intelligent workflows. A platform to create data and algorithm pipelines, NVIDIA Clara consists of libraries for data and image processing, AI model processing, and visualization. For AI, the toolkit includes libraries for data annotation, model training, model adaptation, model federation and large-scale deployment.

Making the vision of the ACR AI-LAB a reality requires the collaboration of the entire ecosystem, including industry leaders GE Healthcare, Nuance and NVIDIA, along with a vast network of healthcare startups and leading research institutes. NVIDIA Clara powers GE Healthcare’s Edison AI platform and the Nuance AI Marketplace, both of which are supporting the AI-LAB and are key solutions for the deployment of AI within the radiology workflow.

“This collaboration marks a significant milestone in an extraordinary ACR Data Science Institute project, helping enable the launch of the ACR AI-LAB, giving radiologists in any practice environment an opportunity to become involved in AI development at their own institutions, using their own patient data to meet their own clinical needs,” said Bibb Allen Jr., M.D., FACR and chief medical officer of the Data Science Institute at the American College of Radiology.

“NVIDIA builds platforms that democratize the use of AI and we purpose-built the Clara AI toolkit to give every radiologist the opportunity to develop AI tools that are customized to their patients and their clinical practice,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of Healthcare at NVIDIA. “Our successful pilot with the ACR is the first of many that will make AI more accessible to the entire field of radiology.”

Successful Pilot Paves Way to Democratized AI for Healthcare

An initial pilot with the Ohio State University (OSU) and the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) helped NVIDIA and ACR define the assets and pathways necessary to enable facilities to work together and with industry to refine AI algorithms without sharing potentially sensitive patient data. Bringing an AI model to the patient data, instead of patient data to the model, can help increase diversity in algorithm training, facilitate validation of the algorithms and enable radiologists to learn the steps needed to adapt algorithms to their institutions’ clinical needs.

Using the NVIDIA Clara AI toolkit, OSU was able to quickly import a pre-trained model developed by CCDS. This model was customized to local variables and successfully labeled OSU data for further testing and improvement of the algorithm, all of which took place behind their own firewall. It resulted in a highly accurate and enhanced cardiac computed tomography angiography model, and the shared approach reduced algorithm training, validation and testing times by days.

“This software will offer radiologists, without computer programming experience, the ability to build and improve AI algorithms without the need to share their data,” said Keith Dreyer, D.O., Ph.D., chief data science officer at Partners Healthcare and associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. “Algorithms typically work best within the sites where they were trained, but those limited training sets are not always representative of the population at large. Training AI models on data from diverse sites helps ensure resiliency while reducing algorithm bias, resulting in improved inference across broader populations.”

“Enabling a network of artificial intelligence between hospitals will create more robust algorithms, greater efficiencies and likely lead to better patient outcomes,” said Dr. Richard White, chair of the department of Radiology and Medical Imaging Informatics at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “This will give us access to high-quality algorithms that will help us accelerate deep learning and machine learning in healthcare.”

The architecture used in the pilot program, powered by the NVIDIA Clara AI toolkit, enables data aggregation, image annotation, image pre-processing and transformation, algorithm transfer and local computing for algorithm improvement, all of which are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the democratization of AI.

Ecosystem Support for ACR AI-LAB and NVIDIA Clara

Strong support for the ACR AI-LAB comes from NVIDIA Clara AI platform users and industry leaders GE Healthcare and Nuance.

“Democratizing AI takes not only state-of-the-art technology, but also close collaboration among industry leaders,” said Keith Bigelow, senior vice president of Edison Portfolio Strategy at GE Healthcare. “By supporting the ACR community’s AI-LAB efforts and harnessing the power of NVIDIA’s Clara AI platform, GE Healthcare can lower costs and improve patient outcomes by accelerating the number of algorithms created and seamlessly deployed to Edison-powered healthcare devices and applications in hospitals nationwide. GE Healthcare looks forward to enabling the fastest path to compliant and productive use of ACR AI-LAB algorithms in our world leading medical devices and workflow applications.”

“Combining the strength of the NVIDIA Clara AI platform with the scale of the Nuance AI Marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging will empower ACR AI-LAB developers to rapidly build and seamlessly deploy AI algorithms into the existing clinical workflows of over 70 percent of all radiologists across more than 5,800 connected healthcare facilities,” said Karen Holzberger, vice president and general manager of Healthcare Diagnostics at Nuance. “Furthermore, the ubiquitous footprint of Nuance PowerScribe radiology reporting and PowerShare image-sharing solutions provides subscribers of our AI Marketplace with immediate access to the largest storefront of imaging AI algorithms that can be automatically integrated into the radiology reporting and interpretation tools they use every day.”

ACR-AI LAB Planned Debut and Availability

The initial version of ACR AI-LAB will be shown at the 2019 ACR Annual Meeting in Washington, from May 18-22. Attendees will be able to explore and experiment with the AI tools necessary to modify and refine AI models.

Soon after, ACR plans to provide online access and sample data from publicly available patient datasets.

The ACR AI-LAB builds upon the ACR TRIAD (Transfer of Images and Data), a platform that already connects thousands of radiology practices for ACR research, accreditation and registry program. Through the ACR AI-LAB, these same radiologists will now be provided with user-friendly computational tools that will help them learn about annotating datasets and training AI models as well as sample the AI tools that can be used to train and modify existing AI algorithms.",http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

GPU Technology Conference—NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT on NVIDIA ® Jetson™ to enable customers to deploy AI and deep learning to millions of connected devices.

This joint solution enables models to be easily created, trained and optimized on AWS, then deployed to Jetson-powered edge devices using AWS IoT Greengrass.

The NVIDIA Jetson platform offers AI at the edge with high-performance and power-efficient computing. Applications include autonomous machines and smart cameras for industries such as retail, manufacturing, agriculture and more.

AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS to edge devices, including machine learning inference, so they can act locally on the data they generate while still using the cloud for management, analytics and durable storage. Jetson-powered devices perform inference at the edge to take near real-time action using AWS IoT Greengrass. Data is then sent back to machine learning services such as Amazon SageMaker to improve model accuracy.

Jetson comes with a comprehensive set of software tools and SDKs, including NVIDIA JetPack™ . It also supports multiple frameworks such as MXNet, Caffe, TensorFlow and PyTorch, so developers can use these algorithms to quickly deploy real-world applications.

“Jetson is a high-performance computer that’s built on the same architecture and unified software that powers the world’s fastest supercomputers,” said Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of Autonomous Machines at NVIDIA. “We offer the new Jetson Nano all the way to Jetson AGX Xavier, so IoT devices can now scale from small IoT devices to powerful IoT gateways.”

Jetson and AWS IoT Greengrass make it easy to deploy machine learning models optimized to run on IoT devices. Customers can save bandwidth and cost by running near real-time inference directly on a Jetson-powered device instead of sending data to the cloud first.

A Variety of Use Cases Made Smarter

Jetson brings AI to applications that were once unimaginable. In high-precision agriculture, Jetson-powered cameras running AWS IoT Greengrass can target weeds in near real time, capture previously unidentified weeds, upload anomalies to the cloud, and retrain and deploy the model quickly. This powerful technology combination makes agriculture smarter and more efficient to help feed the world’s growing population.

For automated optical inspection, product defects can be quickly identified on factory floors to avoid delays on manufacturing assembly lines. This increases productivity and minimizes losses to improve overall operational efficiency.

In retail, Jetson-powered devices can monitor inventory, customer behavior, and checkout and process data on the edge, using AWS IoT Greengrass to deploy trained neural networks.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2019 GPU Technology Conference -- NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation™ autonomous vehicle simulation platform is now available.

The cloud-based platform enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across a broad range of scenarios — from routine driving to rare and dangerous situations — with greater efficiency, cost-effectiveness and safety than what is possible to achieve in the real world.

First introduced at GTC last year , DRIVE Constellation is a data center solution comprised of two side-by-side servers. One server — DRIVE Constellation Simulator — uses NVIDIA GPUs running DRIVE Sim™ software to generate the sensor output from the virtual car driving in a virtual world. The other server — DRIVE Constellation Vehicle — contains the DRIVE AGX Pegasus™ AI car computer, which processes the simulated sensor data.

The driving decisions from DRIVE Constellation Vehicle are fed back into DRIVE Constellation Simulator, enabling bit-accurate, timing-accurate hardware-in-the-loop testing.

Simulation will become a key component for third-party and regulatory autonomous vehicle standards. Safety agencies such as TÜV SÜD are already using the platform to formulate their self-driving validation standards .

“TÜV SÜD is looking for simulation tools that are trustworthy, robust and scalable for the approval of autonomous vehicles,” said Houssem Abdellatif, global head of Autonomous Driving and ADAS at TÜV SÜD. “NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation provides a powerful and highly scalable solution to achieve this goal.”

The importance of simulation is recognized by the world’s largest automaker. NVIDIA also announced today that Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development (TRI-AD) is the first customer of DRIVE Constellation. “We believe large-scale simulation tools for software validation and testing are critical for automated driving systems,” said Dr. James Kuffner, CEO of TRI-AD.

Cloud-Based, End-to-End Workflow

On stage at GTC, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang demonstrated the scalability of the DRIVE Constellation platform seamlessly performing driving tests in the cloud. Developers anywhere in the world can submit simulation scenarios to DRIVE Constellation data centers and evaluate the results from their desks.

This large-scale validation capability is comparable to operating an entire fleet of test vehicles, however, it is able to accomplish years of testing in a fraction of the time.

Open Platform

DRIVE Constellation is an open platform into which ecosystem partners can integrate their environment models, vehicle models, sensor models and traffic scenarios. By incorporating datasets from the broader simulation ecosystem, the platform can generate comprehensive, diverse and complex testing environments.

To this end, Cognata, a simulation company, announced today that its scenario and traffic model can be supported on DRIVE Constellation. With Cognata’s traffic models, developers can define a number of vehicles and other road users, as well as their behavior, based on real-world traffic behavior.

“Cognata and NVIDIA are creating a robust solution that will efficiently and safely accelerate autonomous vehicles’ market entry,” said Danny Atsmon, CEO of Cognata. “Highly accurate and scalable traffic model simulation technology is essential to validate autonomous vehicle systems with very large combinations of real-world scenarios.”

IPG Automotive, a leading automotive simulation company, is another ecosystem partner working with NVIDIA to enable a high-fidelity vehicle models. Its simulation software, CarMaker, is used to create virtual vehicle prototypes, including models of all main vehicle subsystems.

GPU Technology Conference—NVIDIA today bolstered its NVIDIA DRIVE™ AV autonomous vehicle software suite with a planning and control layer designed to enable a safe and comfortable driving experience. A primary component of this software is Safety Force Field™ (SFF™), a robust driving policy that protects the vehicle, its occupants and other road users.

SFF analyzes and predicts the dynamics of the surrounding environment by taking in sensor data and determining a set of actions to protect the vehicle and other road users. The SFF framework ensures these actions will never create, escalate or contribute to an unsafe situation and includes actions necessary to mitigate potential danger.

Backed by robust calculations, SFF makes it possible for vehicles to achieve safety based on mathematical zero-collisions verifications, rather than attempting to model the high complexity of real-world scenarios via limited statistics. Running on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform , frame-by-frame, physics-based SFF computations are performed on vehicle sensor data.

SFF has also undergone validation using real-world data and bit-accurate simulation, including scenarios involving highway and urban driving that would be too dangerous to recreate in the real world.

Mitigating Dangerous Situations and Eliminating Collisions

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that approximately 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error. The industry is working toward zero accidents with the development of autonomous vehicles. Augmenting the DRIVE AV platform with safety features such as path planning, prediction and SFF is a leap forward to achieving this goal.

Unique to SFF is its ability to take into account both braking and steering constraints. This dual consideration helps eliminate several problematic vehicle behavior anomalies that could arise if they were separated. The policy follows one core principle of collision avoidance as opposed to a large set of rules and exceptions.

“By removing human error from the driving equation, we can prevent the vast majority of collisions and minimize the impact of those that do occur,” said David Nister, vice president of Autonomous Driving Software at NVIDIA. “SFF is mathematically designed such that autonomous vehicles equipped with SFF will, like magnets that repel each other, keep themselves out of harm’s way and not contribute to unsafe situations.”

Open and Transparent

SFF is an open platform and can be combined with any driving software. As a safety-decision making policy in the motion planning stack, SFF monitors and prevents unsafe actions. It cleanly separates obstacle avoidance from a long tail of complicated rules of the road. When running on a high-performance compute platform like NVIDIA DRIVE, it adds another layer of diversity and redundancy features to deliver the highest levels of safety.",http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/sites/219/images/social-image.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

It all points to an exciting future for gamers.”

World’s Most Popular Game Engines Integrate Ray Tracing Support

Game engines are software development platforms that include all the core functionality developers need to create video games, from authoring and scripting to AI, physics and rendering.

Integrating into game engines new features such as real-time ray tracing can accelerate the development process. It also makes the features available to all users of a game engine, which include engineers and programmers as well as content creators and artists.

Two of the world’s most popular commercial game engines, Unreal Engine and Unity , have announced the imminent integration of ray tracing features, which game developers will use to add ray-traced effects that can run in real time on NVIDIA GeForce GPUs.

Unreal Engine 4.22 is available in preview now, with final release details expected in Epic’s GDC keynote on Wednesday. Starting on April 4, Unity will offer optimized, production-focused, real-time ray tracing support with a custom experimental build available on GitHub to all users with full preview access in the 2019.03 Unity release.

Real-time ray tracing support from other first-party AAA game engines includes DICE/EA’s Frostbite Engine, Remedy Entertainment’s Northlight Engine and engines from Crystal Dynamics, Kingsoft, Netease and others.

“In the near future, I believe every AAA title will incorporate real-time ray tracing,” said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research . “The integration of real-time ray tracing by the two dominant game engines illustrates the game industry’s belief that real-time ray tracing is the future of gaming graphics. Historically, game engine integration represents a tipping point for technology and is followed by industry-wide adoption.”

Ray Tracing-Capable GPU Installed Base Grows to Tens of Millions

NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPUs powered by Pascal and Turing architectures(1) will be able to take advantage of ray tracing-supported games via a driver expected in April. The new driver will enable tens of millions of GPUs for games that support real-time ray tracing, accelerating the growth of the technology and giving game developers a massive installed base.

With this driver, GeForce GTX GPUs will execute ray traced effects on shader cores. Game performance will vary based on the ray-traced effects and on the number of rays cast in the game, along with GPU model and game resolution. Games that support the Microsoft DXR and Vulkan APIs are all supported.

However, GeForce RTX GPUs, which have dedicated ray tracing cores built directly into the GPU, deliver the ultimate ray tracing experience. They provide up to 2-3x faster ray tracing performance with a more visually immersive gaming environment than GPUs without dedicated ray tracing cores.

GameWorks RTX: Driving Development of Ray Traced Games

NVIDIA GameWorks RTX is a comprehensive set of tools that help developers implement real-time ray-traced effects in games. GameWorks RTX is available to the developer community in open source form under the GameWorks™ license and includes plugins for Unreal Engine 4.22 and Unity’s 2019.03 preview release.

Included in GameWorks RTX:

RTX Denoiser SDK – a library that enables fast, real-time ray tracing by providing denoising techniques to lower the required ray count and samples per pixel. It includes algorithms for ray traced area light shadows, glossy reflections, ambient occlusion and diffuse global illumination.

GPU Technology Conference -- NVIDIA today announced that the world’s top 3D application providers — makers of the most important tools for design and content creation — have adopted NVIDIA RTX™ ray-tracing technology in their upcoming product releases.

NVIDIA RTX brings their customers — over 9 million active artists and designers — breakthroughs such as the ability to interact with complex models and scenes with ray-traced lighting, the industry’s fastest speed of rendering photorealistic images, and new AI-based capabilities to speed the production process.

“When you’re designing a building or bringing a character to life for your movie, the ability to visualize your creation with correct lighting and accurate materials rather than a low-resolution approximation dramatically improves your workflow,” said Greg Estes, vice president of Developer Programs at NVIDIA. “We’re thrilled with the broad industry adoption of NVIDIA RTX, which speaks volumes on how real-time ray tracing is transforming the 3D market.”

NVIDIA RTX is built on the NVIDIA Turing™ GPU architecture, which features RT Cores, the industry’s first on-GPU hardware designed specifically for ray tracing, and Tensor Cores for AI acceleration. Launched at SIGGRAPH 2018, in less than a year NVIDIA RTX has gained support from some of the world’s leading software providers.

“Pixar artists already rely on NVIDIA ray tracing, and RTX more than doubles the performance they will see. We’re excited to use RTX on our upcoming films,” said Steve May, CTO of Pixar Animation Studios.

“RTX technology is a game changer for our architectural visualization pipeline,” said Gamma Basra, partner and head of Visualization at Fosters+Partners. “We can iterate options to ascertain the optimal design in real time without the need to wait hours for the render to come back.”

Why Ray Tracing Is Important to Artists and Designers

Ray tracing simulates the behavior of light in the physical world. It has been too computationally intensive to be practical for artists to use in viewing their creations interactively. This has forced them to compromise, viewing a low-fidelity visualization while creating and not seeing the final correct image until hours later after rendering on a CPU-based render farm.

Now, instead of working with low-res approximations, NVIDIA RTX technology allows artists and designers to interact with ray-traced images that can be indistinguishable from photographs or interact with complex models in real time. With the unprecedented 3D application support for RTX technology, and availability of NVIDIA RTX GPUs in the cloud, in the data center and on the desktop, creators can get optimal performance in any studio workflow.

Leading visual effects studios are among the first to see the value of NVIDIA RTX. ILM, Image Engine, MPC Film and Weta Digital are at the forefront of bringing this new capability to artists.

For architects and product design professionals who need absolute realism to understand lighting conditions and how different materials will affect the look of a design, adding accelerated ray tracing to their preferred software applications can have a profound impact. Leading companies working with RTX include Cannon Design, Foster & Partners, Kohler and KPF.

“This was a turbulent close to what had been a great year,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The combination of post-crypto excess channel inventory and recent deteriorating end-market conditions drove a disappointing quarter.

“Despite this setback, NVIDIA’s fundamental position and the markets we serve are strong. The accelerated computing platform we pioneered is central to some of the world’s most important and fastest growing industries – from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to robotics. We fully expect to return to sustained growth,” he said.

Capital Return

In fiscal 2019, NVIDIA returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.58 billion in share repurchases and $371 million in quarterly cash dividends.

Of the $3.00 billion NVIDIA intends to return to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020, $700 million in share repurchases were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of our Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CES -- NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060, putting revolutionary Turing architecture GPUs within the reach of tens of millions PC gamers worldwide.

The RTX 2060 GPU delivers exceptional performance on modern games, with graphics enhanced by ray tracing and AI capabilities. Priced at $349, RTX 2060 delivers new levels of performance and features previously available only in high-end gaming GPUs.

The RTX 2060 is 60 percent faster on current titles than the prior-generation GTX 1060, NVIDIA’s most popular GPU, and beats the gameplay of the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti.(1) With Turing’s RT Cores and Tensor Cores, it can run Battlefield V with ray tracing at 60 frames per second.

The RTX 2060 will be available globally starting Jan. 15 from every major OEM, system builder and graphics card partner.

“Next-gen gaming starts today for tens of millions of gamers everywhere,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who unveiled the RTX 2060 at the start of the CES tradeshow. “Desktop gamers are demanding, and the RTX 2060 sets a new standard — an unbeatable price, extraordinary performance and real-time ray tracing that blurs the distinction between movies and games. This is a great moment for gamers and our industry.”

Power of Turing

The RTX 2060 features a major upgrade of the core streaming multiprocessor to more efficiently handle the compute-heavy workloads of modern games. It supports concurrent execution of floating point and integer operations, adaptive shading technology and a new unified memory architecture with twice the cache of its predecessor. Modern games can utilize these features to achieve up to 2x the performance of the GTX 1060 GPU.

The RTX 2060 comes equipped with 6GB of GDDR6 memory and 240 Tensor Cores that can deliver 52 teraflops of deep learning horsepower, which can improve gaming performance through a feature known as Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).

DLSS leverages a deep neural network to extract multidimensional features of the rendered scene and intelligently combine details from multiple frames to construct a high-quality final image. The result is a clear, crisp image with similar quality as traditional rendering, but with higher performance.

Battlefield V with DLSS Coming Soon

Electronic Arts and DICE will shortly release an update to Battlefield V that will incorporate DLSS support, as well as additional optimizations for real-time ray tracing. Pairing DLSS with ray tracing allows gamers to get both amazing performance and ray-traced image quality.

Testing with early builds shows that RTX performance with DLSS and ray tracing simultaneously enabled can provide comparable frame rates to playing with ray tracing disabled.

Powerful Capture and Sharing Tools with GeForce Experience

The RTX 2060 comes with GeForce Experience™ , an application that makes PC gaming more accessible and provides unique, easy-to-use in-game features such as:

NVIDIA Highlights — which automatically captures the best gaming moments.

GTC China -- Adoption of the NVIDIA® T4 Cloud GPU is accelerating, with more tech giants unveiling products and services based on what is already the fastest-adopted server GPU , NVIDIA announced today.

Following a series of announcements last week, Baidu, Tencent, JD.com and iFLYTEK have begun using T4 to expand and accelerate their hyperscale datacenters. In addition, China’s leading computer makers — including Inspur, Lenovo, Huawei, Sugon, IPS and H3C — have announced a wide range of new T4 servers.

NVIDIA T4 is being used to accelerate AI inference and training in a broad range of fields, including healthcare, finance and retail, which are key elements in the global high performance computing market for enterprise and hyperscale.

This follows NVIDIA’s announcement at the recent SC18 supercomputing show that, just two months after its introduction, T4 is featured in 57 separate server designs from the world’s leading computer makers. Additionally, Google Cloud announced T4 availability to its Google Cloud Platform customers.

Among previously announced server companies featuring the NVIDIA T4 are Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo and Supermicro.

“The continued rapid adoption of T4 makes complete sense, given its unprecedented capabilities,” said Ian Buck, vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “Never before have we introduced a GPU that gives public and private clouds the combined performance and energy efficiency they need to more economically run their compute-intensive workloads at scale. And in markets where ‘scale’ really counts, we expect T4 to be extremely popular.”

Based on the new NVIDIA Turing™ architecture, the T4 GPU features multi-precision Turing Tensor Cores and new RT Cores, which, when combined with accelerated containerized software stacks, deliver unprecedented performance at scale.

Among China server companies featuring T4 GPUs are Inspur, Huawei, Lenovo, Sugon, Inspur Power System and H3C. Their new systems include:

Inspur NF5280M4 /NF5280M5/NF5288M5/NF5468M5

Huawei G2500/2288 HV5/ 5288V5/G530 V5/G560 V5

Lenovo ThinkSystem SR630/SR650

Sugon X580-G30/X745-G30/X780-G30/X780-G35/X785-G30 / X740-H30

Inspur Power System: FP5295G2

H3C Uniserver G4900G3

Systems are expected to begin shipping before the end of the year.

Flexible Design, Breakthrough Performance

Designed to meet the unique needs of scale-out public and enterprise cloud environments, NVIDIA T4 maximizes throughput, utilization and user concurrency, helping customers efficiently address exploding user and data growth.

Roughly the size of a candy bar, the low-profile, 70-watt T4 GPU has the flexibility to fit into a standard server or any Open Compute Project hyperscale server design. Server designs can range from a single T4 GPU all the way up to 20 GPUs in a single node.

The T4 GPU’s multi-precision capabilities power breakthrough AI performance for a wide range of AI workloads at four different levels of precision, offering 8.1 TFLOPS at FP32, 65 TFLOPS at FP16 as well as 130 TOPS of INT8 and 260 TOPS of INT4. For AI inference workloads, a server with two T4 GPUs can replace up to 54 CPU-only servers. For AI training, a server with two T4 GPUs can replace nine dual-socket, CPU-only servers.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5bf4d0cded6ae5486f59a240_856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7/856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7_11e1c094-0c79-4825-8d25-489ae47dcebe-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5bf4d0cded6ae5486f59a240_856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7/856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5bf4d0cded6ae5486f59a240_856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7/856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7_s.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201810/5be9e3a02cfac2304cfe263e_T4+in+server/T4+in+server_s.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5bf4d0cded6ae5486f59a240_856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7/856c2d04-5436-4813-a1ff-3c5892d9bb7_11e1c094-0c79-4825-8d25-489ae47dcebe-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201810/5be9e3a02cfac2304cfe263e_T4+in+server/T4+in+server_mid.jpg'}"

Groundbreaking NVIDIA AI research enables developers for the first time to render entirely synthetic, interactive 3D environments using a model trained on real-world videos.

NeurIPS -- NVIDIA today introduced groundbreaking AI research that enables developers for the first time to render entirely synthetic, interactive 3D environments using a model trained on real-world videos.

Company researchers used a neural network to render synthetic 3D environments in real time. Currently, every object in a virtual world needs to be modeled individually, which is expensive and time consuming. In contrast, the NVIDIA research uses models automatically learned from real video to render objects such as buildings, trees and vehicles.

The technology offers the potential to quickly create virtual worlds for gaming, automotive, architecture, robotics or virtual reality. The network can, for example, generate interactive scenes based on real-world locations or show consumers dancing like their favorite pop stars.

“NVIDIA has been inventing new ways to generate interactive graphics for 25 years, and this is the first time we can do so with a neural network,” said Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA, who led the team developing this work. “Neural networks — specifically generative models — will change how graphics are created. This will enable developers to create new scenes at a fraction of the traditional cost.”

The result of the research is a simple driving game that allows participants to navigate an urban scene. All content is rendered interactively using a neural network that transforms sketches of a 3D world produced by a traditional graphics engine into video. This interactive demo will be shown at the NeurIPS 2018 conference in Montreal.

The generative neural network learned to model the appearance of the world, including lighting, materials and their dynamics. Since the scene is fully synthetically generated, it can be easily edited to remove, modify or add objects.

“The capability to model and recreate the dynamics of our visual world is essential to building intelligent agents,” the researchers wrote in their paper . “Apart from purely scientific interests, learning to synthesize continuous visual experiences has a wide range of applications in computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics,” the researchers explained.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5c056fc22cfac22b9c3d3721_AI_research_side-by-side/AI_research_side-by-side_344046f8-6a9f-422d-ade4-ab32c62c1584-prv.jpg,"{'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/design-visualization.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20235/64970562b3aed36564b60f97_nvidia-snowflake/nvidia-snowflake_mid.jpg', 'https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/media/themes/5e8b9e5e2cfac276148d312e/images/NVIDIA-logo-BL.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/healthcare.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec30cb3aed34eab2f12c7_pegatron-factory-digital-twin/pegatron-factory-digital-twin_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/20234/646ec2bcb3aed34eab2f12bc_wpp-generative-ai/wpp-generative-ai_mid.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5c056fc22cfac22b9c3d3721_AI_research_side-by-side/AI_research_side-by-side_344046f8-6a9f-422d-ade4-ab32c62c1584-prv.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/ai-deeplearning.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/hpc-nvidia-mega-menu-image-hpc-188x106.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/geforce.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/219/files/201811/5c056fc22cfac22b9c3d3721_AI_research_side-by-side/AI_research_side-by-side_mid.jpg', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/data-center.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/self-driving-cars.png', 'https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/navigation/intelligent-machines.png'}"

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other, contributions, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of our Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SC18—NVIDIA’s position as the most dynamic force in global supercomputing was confirmed today in the just-issued TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers.

The closely watched list, released at the start of the SC18 annual high performance computing conference, shows a 48 percent jump in one year in the number of systems using NVIDIA GPU accelerators. The total climbed to 127 from 86 a year ago, and is three times greater than five years ago.

Moreover, NVIDIA GPUs power the world’s two fastest supercomputers — the U.S. Department of Energy’s Summit, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Sierra, at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Combined, the two systems feature more than 40,000 NVIDIA® V100 Tensor Core GPUs, which enabled the world’s leading researchers to do groundbreaking research recognized in five out of this year’s six finalists for the Gordon Bell Prize , to be awarded during this week’s SC18 conference.

Europe’s and Japan’s fastest supercomputers are also accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs.

Also released today, the Green500 list, which measures the energy-efficiency of the world’s fastest systems, shows that NVIDIA powers 22 of the top 25 “greenest” systems.

The latest list marks another milestone — for the first time, nearly half of its compute power — 702 of 1,417 petaflops — comes from accelerated systems. Prior to 10 years ago, no accelerated systems appeared on the list.

“This is a breakout year for NVIDIA in the world of supercomputing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With the end of Moore’s law, a new HPC market has emerged, fueled by new AI and machine learning workloads. These rely as never before on our high-performance, highly efficient GPU platform to provide the power required to address the most challenging problems in science and society.”

The latest list shows that 52, or one-third, of the 153 systems debuting on the TOP500 are GPU-accelerated, compared with 33 new GPU-accelerated systems on the list a year ago.

Among the new systems this year is NVIDIA DGX-2 POD™, at No. 61. The first DGX-2 cluster appearing on the list, it combines 36 DGX-2 systems and delivers more than 3 petaflops of double-precision performance.

GTC Europe—NVIDIA today announced a GPU-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning, with broad adoption from industry leaders, that enables even the largest companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed.

RAPIDS™ open-source software gives data scientists a giant performance boost as they address highly complex business challenges, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. Reflecting the growing consensus about the GPU’s importance in data analytics, an array of companies is supporting RAPIDS — from pioneers in the open-source community, such as Databricks and Anaconda, to tech leaders like Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM and Oracle.

Analysts estimate the server market for data science and machine learning at $20 billion annually, which — together with scientific analysis and deep learning — pushes up the value of the high performance computing market to approximately $36 billion.

“Data analytics and machine learning are the largest segments of the high performance computing market that have not been accelerated — until now,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, who revealed RAPIDS in his keynote address at the GPU Technology Conference . “The world’s largest industries run algorithms written by machine learning on a sea of servers to sense complex patterns in their market and environment, and make fast, accurate predictions that directly impact their bottom line.

“Building on CUDA and its global ecosystem, and working closely with the open-source community, we have created the RAPIDS GPU-acceleration platform. It integrates seamlessly into the world’s most popular data science libraries and workflows to speed up machine learning. We are turbocharging machine learning like we have done with deep learning,” he said.

RAPIDS offers a suite of open-source libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. It has been developed over the past two years by NVIDIA engineers in close collaboration with key open-source contributors.

For the first time, it gives scientists the tools they need to run the entire data science pipeline on GPUs. Initial RAPIDS benchmarking, using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm for training on an NVIDIA DGX-2™ system , shows 50x speedups compared with CPU-only systems. This allows data scientists to reduce typical training times from days to hours, or from hours to minutes, depending on the size of their dataset.

Close Collaboration with Open-Source Community

RAPIDS builds on popular open-source projects — including Apache Arrow, pandas and scikit-learn — by adding GPU acceleration to the most popular Python data science toolchain. To bring additional machine learning libraries and capabilities to RAPIDS, NVIDIA is collaborating with such open-source ecosystem contributors as Anaconda, BlazingDB, Databricks, Quansight and scikit-learn, as well as Wes McKinney, head of Ursa Labs and creator of Apache Arrow and pandas, the fastest-growing Python data science library.

“RAPIDS, a GPU-accelerated data science platform, is a next-generation computational ecosystem powered by Apache Arrow,” McKinney said. “NVIDIA’s collaboration with Ursa Labs will accelerate the pace of innovation in the core Arrow libraries and help bring about major performance boosts in analytics and feature engineering workloads.”

To facilitate broad adoption, NVIDIA is integrating RAPIDS into Apache Spark, the leading open-source framework for analytics and data science.

“At Databricks, we are excited about RAPIDS’ potential to accelerate Apache Spark workloads,” said Matei Zaharia, co-founder and chief technologist of Databricks, and original creator of Apache Spark. “We have multiple ongoing projects to integrate Spark better with native accelerators, including Apache Arrow support and GPU scheduling with Project Hydrogen. We believe that RAPIDS is an exciting new opportunity to scale our customers’ data science and AI workloads.”

SIGGRAPH — NVIDIA today reinvented computer graphics with the launch of the NVIDIA Turing™ GPU architecture.

The greatest leap since the invention of the CUDA GPU in 2006, Turing features new RT Cores to accelerate ray tracing and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing which, together for the first time, make real-time ray tracing possible.

These two engines — along with more powerful compute for simulation and enhanced rasterization — usher in a new generation of hybrid rendering to address the $250 billion visual effects industry. Hybrid rendering enables cinematic-quality interactive experiences, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models.

The company also unveiled its initial Turing-based products — the NVIDIA® Quadro® RTX™ 8000, Quadro RTX 6000 and Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs — which will revolutionize the work of some 50 million designers and artists across multiple industries.

“Turing is NVIDIA’s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, speaking at the start of the annual SIGGRAPH conference. “Hybrid rendering will change the industry, opening up amazing possibilities that enhance our lives with more beautiful designs, richer entertainment and more interactive experiences. The arrival of real-time ray tracing is the holy grail of our industry.”

NVIDIA’s eighth-generation GPU architecture, Turing enables the world’s first ray-tracing GPU and is the result of more than 10,000 engineering-years of effort. By using Turing’s hybrid rendering capabilities, applications can simulate the physical world at 6x the speed of the previous Pascal™ generation.

To help developers take full advantage of these capabilities, NVIDIA has enhanced its RTX development platform with new AI, ray-tracing and simulation SDKs. It also announced that key graphics applications addressing millions of designers, artists and scientists are planning to take advantage of Turing features through the RTX development platform.

“This is a significant moment in the history of computer graphics,” said Jon Peddie, CEO of analyst firm JPR. “NVIDIA is delivering real-time ray tracing five years before we had thought possible.”

Real-Time Ray Tracing Accelerated by RT Cores

The Turing architecture is armed with dedicated ray-tracing processors called RT Cores, which accelerate the computation of how light and sound travel in 3D environments at up to 10 GigaRays a second. Turing accelerates real-time ray tracing operations by up to 25x that of the previous Pascal generation, and GPU nodes can be used for final-frame rendering for film effects at more than 30x the speed of CPU nodes.

“Cinesite is proud to partner with Autodesk and NVIDIA to bring Arnold to the GPU, but we never expected to see results this dramatic,” said Michele Sciolette, CTO of Cinesite. “This means we can iterate faster, more frequently and with higher quality settings. This will completely change how our artists work.”

AI Accelerated by Powerful Tensor Cores

The Turing architecture also features Tensor Cores, processors that accelerate deep learning training and inferencing, providing up to 500 trillion tensor operations a second.

This level of performance powers AI-enhanced features for creating applications with powerful new capabilities. These include DLAA — deep learning anti-aliasing, which is a breakthrough in high-quality motion image generation — denoising, resolution scaling and video re-timing.

These features are part of the NVIDIA NGX™ software development kit, a new deep learning-powered technology stack that enables developers to easily integrate accelerated, enhanced graphics, photo imaging and video processing into applications with pre-trained networks.

Faster Simulation and Rasterization with New Turing Streaming Multiprocessor

Turing-based GPUs feature a new streaming multiprocessor (SM) architecture that adds an integer execution unit executing in parallel with the floating point datapath, and a new unified cache architecture with double the bandwidth of the previous generation.

Combined with new graphics technologies such as variable rate shading, the Turing SM achieves unprecedented levels of performance per core. With up to 4,608 CUDA cores, Turing supports up to 16 trillion floating point operations in parallel with 16 trillion integer operations per second.

Developers can take advantage of NVIDIA’s CUDA 10, FleX and PhysX SDKs to create complex simulations, such as particles or fluid dynamics for scientific visualization, virtual environments and special effects.

Availability

Quadro GPUs based on Turing will be initially available in the fourth quarter.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 2387419. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com , and at www.streetevents.com . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2019.



Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the provisional tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of our Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

At Adobe Summit, Adobe and NVIDIA today announced a strategic partnership to rapidly enhance their industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies. Building on years of collaboration, the companies will work to optimize the Adobe Sensei AI and machine learning (ML) framework for NVIDIA® GPUs. The collaboration will speed time to market and improve performance of new Sensei-powered services for Adobe Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud customers and developers.

The partnership advances Adobe's strategy to extend the availability of Sensei APIs and to broaden the Sensei ecosystem to a new audience of developers, data scientists and partners.

“Combining NVIDIA's best-in-class AI capabilities with Adobe's leading creative and digital experience solutions, all powered by Sensei, will allow us to deliver higher-performing AI services to customers and developers more quickly,” said Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO, Adobe. “We're excited to partner with NVIDIA to push the boundaries of what's possible in creativity, marketing and exciting new areas like immersive media.”

“AI is the ultimate assistant – delighting artists with magical capabilities to further their creativity, and helping businesses of every kind to gain insights and efficiencies,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. “Our work with Adobe brings AI within reach for millions of individuals working in the creative and marketing fields, providing them with tools offering performance that was unimaginable just a short time ago.”

Adobe and NVIDIA have worked together for more than a decade on enabling GPU acceleration for a broad set of Adobe's creative and digital experience products. This includes Sensei-powered features, such as auto lip sync in Adobe Character Animator CC and face aware editing in Photoshop CC, as well as cloud-based AI/ML products and features, such as image analysis for Adobe Stock and Lightroom CC and auto-tagging in Adobe Experience Manager.

The companies also plan to work on optimizing Sensei AI services for NVIDIA hardware in the cloud and at the edge, for improved performance and new capabilities. In addition, they plan to explore packaging and delivering easy-to-use Sensei AI services to NVIDIA's ecosystem of developers. This includes services targeted at creative mediums, such as mixed reality, next-generation rendering like NVIDIA’s new RTX real-time ray-tracing technology, and other new immersive experiences.

CEOs Discuss Future of AI

Speaking at the opening keynote of GTC 2018, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced NVIDIA DRIVE™ Constellation, a computing platform based on two different servers.

The first server runs NVIDIA DRIVE Sim software to simulate a self-driving vehicle’s sensors, such as cameras, lidar and radar. The second contains a powerful NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus™ AI car computer that runs the complete autonomous vehicle software stack and processes the simulated data as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road.

“Deploying production self-driving cars requires a solution for testing and validating on billions of driving miles to achieve the safety and reliability needed for customers,” said Rob Csongor, vice president and general manager of Automotive at NVIDIA. “With DRIVE Constellation, we’ve accomplished that by combining our expertise in visual computing and datacenters. With virtual simulation, we can increase the robustness of our algorithms by testing on billions of miles of custom scenarios and rare corner cases, all in a fraction of the time and cost it would take to do so on physical roads.”

The simulation server is powered by NVIDIA GPUs, each generating a stream of simulated sensor data, which feed into the DRIVE Pegasus for processing.

Driving commands from DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulator, completing the digital feedback loop. This “hardware-in-the-loop” cycle, which occurs 30 times a second, is used to validate that algorithms and software running on Pegasus are operating the simulated vehicle correctly.

DRIVE Sim software generates photoreal data streams to create a vast range of different testing environments. It can simulate different weather such as rainstorms and snowstorms; blinding glare at different times of the day, or limited vision at night; and all different types of road surfaces and terrain. Dangerous situations can be scripted in simulation to test the autonomous car’s ability to react, without ever putting anyone in harm’s way.

“Autonomous vehicles need to be developed with a system that covers training to testing to driving,” said Luca De Ambroggi, research and analyst director at IHS Markit. “NVIDIA’s end-to-end platform is the right approach. DRIVE Constellation for virtually testing and validating will bring us a step closer to the production of self-driving cars.”

NVIDIA announced a new version of its TensorRT inference software, and the integration of TensorRT into Google’s popular TensorFlow framework. NVIDIA also announced that Kaldi, the most popular framework for speech recognition, is now optimized for GPUs. NVIDIA’s close collaboration with partners such as Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft make it easier for developers to take advantage of GPU acceleration using ONNX and WinML.

“GPU acceleration for production deep learning inference enables even the largest neural networks to be run in real time and at the lowest cost,” said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. “With rapidly expanding support for more intelligent applications and frameworks, we can now improve the quality of deep learning and help reduce the cost for 30 million hyperscale servers.”

TensorRT, TensorFlow Integration

NVIDIA unveiled TensorRT 4 software to accelerate deep learning inference across a broad range of applications. TensorRT offers highly accurate INT8 and FP16 network execution, which can cut datacenter costs by up to 70 percent.(1)

TensorRT 4 can be used to rapidly optimize, validate and deploy trained neural networks in hyperscale datacenters, embedded and automotive GPU platforms. The software delivers up to 190x(2) faster deep learning inference compared with CPUs for common applications such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems.

To further streamline development, NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into TensorFlow 1.7, making it easier to run deep learning inference applications on GPUs.

Rajat Monga, engineering director at Google, said, “The TensorFlow team is collaborating very closely with NVIDIA to bring the best performance possible on NVIDIA GPUs to the deep learning community. TensorFlow’s integration with NVIDIA TensorRT now delivers up to 8x higher inference throughput (compared to regular GPU execution within a low-latency target) on NVIDIA deep learning platforms with Volta Tensor Core technology, enabling the highest performance for GPU inference within TensorFlow.”

NVIDIA has optimized the world’s leading speech framework, Kaldi, to achieve faster performance running on GPUs. GPU speech acceleration will mean more accurate and useful virtual assistants for consumers, and lower deployment costs for datacenter operators.

Broad Industry Support

Developers at a wide spectrum of companies around the world are using TensorRT to discover new insights from data and to deploy intelligent services to businesses and consumers.

NVIDIA engineers have worked closely with Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft to ensure developers using ONNX frameworks such as Caffe 2, Chainer, CNTK, MXNet and Pytorch can now easily deploy to NVIDIA deep learning platforms.

Markus Noga, head of Machine Learning at SAP, said, “In our evaluation of TensorRT running our deep learning-based recommendation application on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, we experienced a 45x increase in inference speed and throughput compared with a CPU-based platform. We believe TensorRT could dramatically improve productivity for our enterprise customers.”

Nicolas Koumchatzky, head of Twitter Cortex, said, “Using GPUs made it possible to enable media understanding on our platform, not just by drastically reducing media deep learning models training time, but also by allowing us to derive real-time understanding of live videos at inference time.”

Microsoft also recently announced AI support for Windows 10 applications. NVIDIA partnered with Microsoft to build GPU-accelerated tools to help developers incorporate more intelligent features in Windows applications.

NVIDIA also announced GPU acceleration for Kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multi-cloud GPU clusters. NVIDIA is contributing GPU enhancements to the open-source community to support the Kubernetes ecosystem.

In addition, MathWorks, makers of MATLAB software, today announced TensorRT integration with MATLAB. Engineers and scientists can now automatically generate high-performance inference engines from MATLAB for the NVIDIA DRIVE™, Jetson™, and Tesla® platforms.

Inference for the Datacenter

Datacenter managers constantly balance performance and efficiency to keep their server fleets at maximum productivity. NVIDIA Tesla GPU-accelerated servers can replace several racks of CPU servers for deep learning inference applications and services, freeing up precious rack space and reducing energy and cooling requirements.

Inference for Self-Driving Cars, Embedded

TensorRT can also be deployed on NVIDIA DRIVE autonomous vehicles and NVIDIA Jetson embedded platforms. Deep neural networks on every framework can be trained on NVIDIA DGX™ systems in the datacenter, and then deployed into all types of devices — from robots to autonomous vehicles — for real-time inferencing at the edge.

With TensorRT, developers can focus on developing novel deep learning-powered applications rather than performance tuning for inference deployment. Developers can use TensorRT to deliver lightning-fast inference using INT8 or FP16 precision that significantly reduces latency, which is vital for capabilities like object detection and path planning on embedded and automotive platforms.

NVIDIA RTX is the product of 10 years of work in computer graphics algorithms and GPU architectures. It consists of a highly scalable ray-tracing technology running on NVIDIA Volta architecture GPUs. Architected to support ray tracing through a variety of interfaces, NVIDIA partnered closely with Microsoft to enable full RTX support for applications that use Microsoft’s new DirectX® Raytracing (DXR) API.

Long considered the definitive solution for realistic and lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows, ray tracing offers a level of realism far beyond what is possible using traditional rendering techniques. Real-time ray tracing replaces a majority of the techniques used today in standard rendering with realistic optical calculations that replicate the way light behaves in the real world, delivering more lifelike images.

“Real-time ray tracing has been a dream of the graphics industry and game developers for decades, and NVIDIA RTX is bringing it to life,” said Tony Tamasi, senior vice president of content and technology at NVIDIA. “GPUs are only now becoming powerful enough to deliver real-time ray tracing for gaming applications, and will usher in a new era of next-generation visuals.”

Ray tracing has been used for years to pre-render lifelike worlds in movies. But until now, it has been too computationally demanding to be practical for real-time, interactive gaming, which requires fast frame rates and low latency. NVIDIA RTX overcomes those limitations.

Broad Industry Support

“DirectX Raytracing is the latest example of Microsoft’s commitment toward enabling developers to create incredible experiences using cutting-edge graphics innovations,” said Max McMullen, development manager of Windows Graphics and AI at Microsoft. “Our close partnership with NVIDIA on DirectX Raytracing and NVIDIA’s RTX technology brings real-time ray tracing closer than ever for millions of gamers on Windows.”

Industry leaders such as 4A Games, Epic, Remedy Entertainment and Unity are featuring NVIDIA RTX in their technology demonstrations at the Game Developers Conference this week. They are showing how real-time ray tracing can provide amazing, lifelike graphics in future games. And because RTX supports Microsoft DirectX Raytracing, the groundbreaking technology will be enjoyed by Windows users everywhere.

“The availability of NVIDIA RTX opens the door to make real-time ray tracing a reality,” said Kim Libreri, chief technology officer at Epic Games. “By making such powerful technology available to the game development community with the support of the new DirectX Raytracing API, NVIDIA is the driving force behind the next generation of game and movie graphics.”

“Integrating NVIDIA RTX into our Northlight engine was a relatively straightforward exercise,” said Mikko Orrenmaa, technology team manager at Remedy Entertainment. “Developing exclusively on NVIDIA RTX, we were surprised just how quickly we were able to prototype new lighting, reflection and ambient occlusion techniques, with significantly better visual fidelity than traditional rasterization techniques. We are really excited about what we can achieve in the future with the NVIDIA RTX technology. Gamers are in for something special.”

Introducing GameWorks for Ray Tracing

To allow game developers to take advantage of these new capabilities, NVIDIA also announced the NVIDIA GameWorks™ SDK will add a ray-tracing denoiser module. This suite of tools and resources for developers will dramatically increase realism and shorten product cycles in titles developed using the new Microsoft DXR API and NVIDIA RTX.

The upcoming GameWorks SDK — which will support Volta and future generation GPU architectures — enables ray-traced area shadows, ray-traced glossy reflections and ray-traced ambient occlusion.

With these capabilities, developers can create realistic, high-quality reflections that capture the scene around it and achieve physically accurate lighting and shadows.

NVIDIA also introduced an updated, fully optimized software stack.

Additionally, NVIDIA launched a major breakthrough in deep learning computing with NVIDIA DGX-2™, the first single server capable of delivering two petaflops of computational power. DGX-2 has the deep learning processing power of 300 servers occupying 15 racks of datacenter space, while being 60x smaller and 18x more power efficient.

“The extraordinary advances of deep learning only hint at what is still to come,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, as he unveiled the news at GTC 2018. “Many of these advances stand on NVIDIA’s deep learning platform, which has quickly become the world’s standard. We are dramatically enhancing our platform’s performance at a pace far exceeding Moore’s law, enabling breakthroughs that will help revolutionize healthcare, transportation, science exploration and countless other areas.”

Tesla V100 Gets Double the Memory

The Tesla V100 GPU, widely adopted by the world’s leading researchers, has received a 2x memory boost to handle the most memory-intensive deep learning and high performance computing workloads.

Now equipped with 32GB of memory, Tesla V100 GPUs will help data scientists train deeper and larger deep learning models that are more accurate than ever. They can also improve the performance of memory-constrained HPC applications by up to 50 percent compared with the previous 16GB version.

The Tesla V100 32GB GPU is immediately available across the complete NVIDIA DGX system portfolio. Additionally, major computer manufacturers Cray, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Supermicro and Tyan announced they will begin rolling out their new Tesla V100 32GB systems within the second quarter. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure also announced plans to offer Tesla V100 32GB in the cloud in the second half of the year.

NVSwitch: A Revolutionary Interconnect Fabric

NVSwitch offers 5x higher bandwidth than the best PCIe switch, allowing developers to build systems with more GPUs hyperconnected to each other. It will help developers break through previous system limitations and run much larger datasets. It also opens the door to larger, more complex workloads, including modeling parallel training of neural networks.

NVSwitch extends the innovations made available through NVIDIA NVLink™, the first high-speed interconnect technology developed by NVIDIA. NVSwitch allows system designers to build even more advanced systems that can flexibly connect any topology of NVLink-based GPUs.

Advanced GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning and HPC Software Stack

The updates to NVIDIA’s deep learning and HPC software stack are available at no charge to its developer community, which now totals more than 820,000 registered users, compared with about 480,000 a year ago.

Among its updates are new versions of NVIDIA CUDA®, TensorRT, NCCL and cuDNN, and a new Isaac software developer kit for robotics. Additionally, through close collaboration with leading cloud service providers, every major deep learning framework is continually optimized to take full advantage of NVIDIA’s GPU computing platform.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 6265639. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com/, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the provisional tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company’s Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA DRIVE OS offers full support of Adaptive AUTOSAR, the open-standard automotive system architecture and application framework. The NVIDIA toolchain, including the CUDA® compiler and TensorRT™, uses ISO 26262 Tool Classification Levels to ensure a safe and robust development environment.

Algorithms: The NVIDIA DRIVE AV autonomous vehicle software stack performs functions like ego-motion, perception, localization and path planning. To realize fail operation capability, each functionality includes a redundancy and diversity strategy. For example, perception redundancy is achieved by fusing lidar, camera and radar. Deep learning and computer vision algorithms running on CPU, CUDA GPU, DLA and PVA enhance redundancy and diversity. The NVIDIA DRIVE AV stack is a full backup system to the self-driving stack developed by the automaker, enabling Level 5 autonomous vehicles to achieve the highest level of functional safety.

Virtual Reality Simulation: A self-driving car is an extremely complex system with state-of-the-art technologies. Proving that the system does what it is designed to do —captured by the term SoTIF, or safety of the intended functionality — is a great challenge. And it must do so in a wide range of situations and weather conditions. Road testing is not sufficiently controllable, repeatable, exhaustive or fast, so a realistic simulation environment is essential. NVIDIA has created a virtual reality simulator, called NVIDIA AutoSIM, to test the DRIVE platform and simulate against rare conditions. Running on NVIDIA DGX™ supercomputers, NVIDIA AutoSIM is repeatable for regression testing and will eventually simulate billions of miles.

Industry Partner Support

“The deep learning capabilities that NVIDIA provides combined with BlackBerry QNX’s safety- critical real-time operating system are exactly what automakers want and need,” said John Chen, executive chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “Our partnership with NVIDIA will provide the automotive industry with a functionally safe AI self-driving platform that is secured to the highest standards.”

“We are excited to team up with NVIDIA, the leader in automotive AI technologies, and to contribute our series-proven safety software framework MotionWise for autonomous systems in close partnership with our joint customers,” said Georg Kopetz, CEO of TTTech. “This strategic world-class partnership will jointly bring a complete solution fast to market, ready for the high safety and security requirements for Level 2 to Level 5 – fully fail-operational autonomous systems.”

At the kickoff of CES 2018, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang discussed on stage how AI is transforming the auto industry and highlighted the new I.D. Buzz, Volkswagen’s exciting rebirth of the iconic VW MicroBus, reimagined in electric car form and infused with AI technology for the cockpit and self-driving.

“Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the car,” Diess said. “Autonomous driving, zero-emission mobility and digital networking are virtually impossible without advances in AI and deep learning. Combining the imagination of Volkswagen with NVIDIA, the leader in AI technology, enables us to take a big step into the future.”

“In just a few years, every new vehicle will be expected to have AI assistants for voice, gesture and facial recognition as well as augmented reality,” Huang said. “Volkswagen’s work with NVIDIA DRIVE IX technology will make that a reality. Together, we are building a new generation of cars that are safer, more enjoyable to ride in than anything that has come before, and accessible to everyone.”

The NVIDIA DRIVE IX Intelligent Experience platform is a software development kit for creating AI-enabled applications such as facial recognition for automatically unlocking and opening the vehicle, surround perception to alert the driver to potential hazards, gesture recognition for user controls, natural language understanding for flawless voice control, and gaze tracking for driver distraction alerts.

Focus on Intelligent Co-Pilot Capabilities

The VW I.D. Buzz will use DRIVE IX technology to create “Intelligent Co-Pilot” applications, which will include convenience and assistance systems based on processing sensor data from both inside and outside of the car. The systems can be enhanced throughout the life of the vehicle via software updates, and can gain new capabilities as further developments are made in autonomous driving. Thanks to deep learning, the car of the future will learn to accurately assess situations and analyze the behavior of others on the road, enabling it to make the right decisions.

Volkswagen’s Path to Autonomous Driving

The I.D. Buzz is part of the I.D. family1 with which Volkswagen will launch its electric car campaign and gradually introduce autonomous driving starting in 2020. More than 20 fully electric vehicle models are planned by 2025, as the automaker works toward its goal of becoming the world leader in this area.

These new models are based on the completely new MEB car architecture that is consistently geared toward zero-emission, digital mobility and making use of the electric drive’s overall package benefits. Using a battery that is integrated flat in the chassis floor and a compact drive system, they offer a generous and highly variable interior. To this end, pioneering technologies are available from the electric compact car segment, such as the operating concept featuring an augmented-reality head-up display.

From the start, the models based on the MEB architecture will offer the very latest assistance systems and will be prepared for the respective levels of autonomous driving that are available. The MEB electronic systems will also be gradually introduced to vehicles with conventional drive systems that are based on the MQB architecture.

Recognition of Companies’ Leadership

“NVIDIA is not just at the forefront of developing GPUs and cloud computing, but is also the market leader for AI computing in cars,” said Roger Lanctot, director at Strategy Analytics. “The combination of NVIDIA and Volkswagen has the potential to bring this level of AI capability to everyone. VW I.D. Buzz, with its exciting AI user interfaces, self-driving and improved driver safety, is a sign of the future all of us can imagine.”

Speaking at the opening press conference of CES 2018, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that the collaboration utilizes NVIDIA technology for Uber Advanced Technologies Group’s fleets of self-driving cars and freight trucks, running AI algorithms that enable vehicles to perceive the world, predict what will happen next and quickly choose the best course of action, even in complex environments.

“The future of transportation will be transformed by mobility services. Convenient, affordable mobility-as-a-service will reshape cities and society, and help support the billion-person increase in the world’s population over the next decade,” said Huang. “Autonomous vehicles are the critical technology to making mobility services pervasive. We’re thrilled to be working with Uber to realize this vision.”

Uber began working on self-driving technology in early 2015, and launched the first city trials in Pittsburgh, in fall 2016, followed by a second pilot in Phoenix, starting in early 2017. Over this period, self-driving Ubers have completed more than 50,000 passenger trips and have logged over 2 million autonomous miles.

Uber’s use of NVIDIA’s technology reflects the reality that the computational requirements of self-driving vehicles are enormous. Self-driving cars and trucks must perceive the world through high-resolution, 360-degree surround cameras and lidars; localize the vehicle within centimeter accuracy; detect and track other vehicles and people; and plan a safe, comfortable path to the destination. All this processing must be done with multiple levels of redundancy to ensure the highest level of safety. The computing demands of driverless vehicles are easily 50 to 100 times more intensive than the most advanced cars today.

“Developing safe, reliable autonomous vehicles requires sophisticated AI software and a high-performance GPU computing engine in the vehicle,” said Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. “NVIDIA is a key technology provider to Uber as we bring scalable self-driving cars and trucks to market.”

ZF’s new Xavier-based ProAI will process inputs from multiple cameras, plus lidar and radar, paint a 360-degree view around the vehicle, locate it on an HD map, and find a safe path through traffic.

“Our scalable and modular approach enables us to upgrade to our new ProAI based on NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier, and integrate the Baidu Apollo Pilot. Our second generation ZF ProAI could be customized accordingly and scaled up with a Xavier board, which is available to be implemented,” said Torsten Gollewski, senior vice president of Advanced Engineering at ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

Baidu’s Apollo open autonomous driving platform provides a comprehensive, secure and reliable all-in-one solution that supports all major features and functions of an autonomous vehicle. Apollo Pilot is an autonomous driving product targeted for mass production, which provides a safe, economical and comfortable autonomous driving experience. It’s built on Baidu’s technology and insight from the driving behaviors of Chinese users.

“NVIDIA’s AI supercomputing architecture is ideal for our autonomous driving applications, as it can process huge amounts of data from sensors in real time, and localize the vehicle on our high-definition digital maps,” said Zhenyu Li, vice president and general manager of the Intelligent Driving Group at Baidu. “We’ve been working with NVIDIA on developing on-vehicle chips for autonomous driving, which aims to accelerate the pace of mass production of autonomous vehicles.”

This solution is created not only for Chinese automakers, but any vehicle maker planning to do business in China, and can scale from super Level 2 automated driving capabilities to Level 5 fully autonomous robotaxis. Production vehicles utilizing AI self-driving technologies from NVIDIA, ZF and Baidu are expected on the roads of China starting in 2020.

The partnership – described at GTC Japan by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang – will focus on Komatsu using NVIDIA GPUs to visualize and analyze entire construction sites. The NVIDIA® Jetson™ AI platform will serve as the brain of heavy machinery deployed on these sites, enabling improved safety and productivity.

“Artificial intelligence is sweeping across industries, and its next frontier is autonomous intelligent machines,” said Huang, speaking at NVIDIA’s final of seven global GPU Technology Conferences this year. “Future machines will perceive their surroundings and be continuously alert, helping operators work more efficiently and safely. The construction and mining industries will benefit greatly from these advances.”

Construction is the latest in a series of industries in which NVIDIA has signed agreements with market leaders to help revolutionize how they operate. Among these are partnerships with GE Healthcare and Nuance in the area of medical imaging; FANUC in the field of robotics; and more than 225 car makers, startups and research houses – among them, Audi, Tesla, Toyota and Volvo – for autonomous driving.

Construction Industry Primed for AI’s Benefits

Safety risks and inefficiencies in the construction industry make it particularly well suited for improvements powered by AI.

Construction sites are generally considered among the more dangerous workplaces because of the presence of heavy equipment, uneven terrain and continuous activity. Last year, sites in Japan alone recorded some 300 deaths and more than 15,000 injuries, according to the Japan Construction Occupational Safety and Health Association.

And Japan’s construction industry is particularly challenged because of the nation’s severe labor shortage due to an aging population. Of the 3.4 million skilled workers in the domestic industry (as of 2014), roughly 1.1 million, or one-third, are likely to leave in the next decade, according to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors.

AI to Augment Komatsu’s “SMARTCONSTRUCTION” Initiative

To help address these issues, Komatsu began in 2015 rolling out its “SMARTCONSTRUCTION” initiative, connecting data related to onsite workers and objects to make worksites safer and more productive. The initiative has been introduced in more than 4,000 sites across the country, with plans to expand both domestically and internationally.

“We’ll start integrating NVIDIA GPUs into our construction sites,” said Yuichi Iwamoto, senior executive officer, chief technology officer at Komatsu. “By leveraging NVIDIA’s experience in image processing, virtualization and AI, we can further transform construction areas into jobsites of the future.”



Extending the SMARTCONSTRUCTION initiative, Komatsu will use NVIDIA technology to create 3D visualizations of construction sites, showing the real-time interaction of people, machinery and objects. Costly onsite equipment can be closely monitored to ensure it is used with optimal efficiency.

NVIDIA GPUs will communicate with drones and cameras in the construction sites, acting as an AI platform for analysis and visualization. SkyCatch will provide drones to gather and map 3D images for visualizing the terrain at the edge. OPTiM, an IoT management-software company, will provide an application to identify individuals and machinery collected from surveillance cameras. Both of these Komatsu partners are also members of NVIDIA’s Inception program for AI startups.

At the center of the collaboration is NVIDIA Jetson, a credit-card sized platform that delivers AI computing at the edge. Working in tandem with NVIDIA cloud technology, Jetson will power cameras mounted on Komatsu’s construction equipment and enable 360-degree views to readily identify people and machines nearby to prevent collisions and other accidents.

Jetson will also be used in stereo cameras located in the cabs of construction machines to help assess rapidly changing conditions in real time and instruct the driver accordingly. Future applications include high-resolution rendering and virtual simulations of construction and mining sites along with automated control of machinery.

New NGC Containers, Updates and Features

In addition to making NVIDIA TensorRT available on NGC’s container registry, NVIDIA announced the following NGC updates:

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) support for TensorRT.

Immediate support and availability for the first release of MXNet 1.0

Availability of Baidu’s PaddlePaddle AI framework

ONNX is an open format originally created by Facebook and Microsoft through which developers can exchange models across different frameworks. In the TensorRT development container, NVIDIA created a converter to deploy ONNX models to the TensorRT inference engine. This makes it easier for application developers to deploy low-latency, high-throughput models to TensorRT.

Together, these additions give developers a one-stop shop for software that supports a full spectrum of AI computing needs — from research and application development to training and deployment.

Launched in October, NGC is also available free of charge to users of NVIDIA Volta GPUs on Amazon Web Services and all NVIDIA DGX-1 and DGX Station customers. NVIDIA will continue to expand the reach of NGC over time.

Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM and Lenovo have all announced Volta-based offerings for their customers. Providers such as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and Tencent Cloud have also announced Volta-based cloud services.

Building on this breadth of offerings, NVIDIA has introduced new software and tools on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) container registry that make it easy for scientists to deploy NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform for compute-intensive research.

NVIDIA shared the news at the SC17 supercomputing conference, where dozens of computer makers and cloud service providers launched a wide range of Volta-based products and services.

“Volta is the world’s most powerful platform for AI and HPC, and will allow the world’s top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what’s possible in areas like drug discovery, alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters,” said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. “With Volta now in data centers and clouds around the world, a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society.”

NVIDIA GPU Cloud Adds HPC Containers

More than 500 HPC applications, including the industry’s most widely used, incorporate GPU acceleration. However, one of the biggest challenges facing scientists who want to take advantage of these applications is the complexity of deployment.

NVIDIA’s new containers for scientific computing applications and for HPC visualization tools provide access to some of the most widely used GPU-optimized HPC software. They join the GPU-optimized AI frameworks and deep learning applications the company introduced in the NGC container registry last month.

Together, the offerings make NGC a single source for researchers seeking to easy access, at no charge, to the AI frameworks, HPC applications and visualization tools essential for their scientific workflows.

With NGC, scientists and researchers can focus on discovery rather than setting up and deploying scientific computing applications, and the time-consuming challenges of installing complex, resource-intensive software and updates. The GPU-optimized HPC containers on NGC transform this cumbersome chore, which can take days or weeks to complete, into a simple task that requires only a few minutes.

The HPC application containers encompass several popular third-party scientific applications, including GAMESS, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD and RELION.

The HPC visualization containers now available in beta on NGC feature the industry’s leading visualization tools, including ParaView with NVIDIA IndeX™ volume renderer, NVIDIA Optix™ ray-tracing library and NVIDIA Holodeck™ for interactive real-time visualization and high-quality visuals.

The complete set of GPU-accelerated deep learning, HPC application and HPC visualization containers are available to users at no charge from the NGC container registry. Simply sign up for an NGC account. The HPC containers can run on any NVIDIA Pascal™ and later generation NVIDIA GPU-accelerated system, including local workstations, NVIDIA DGX™ systems and HPC supercomputing clusters.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2018 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 96232617. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, loss on early debt conversions, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company’s Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

DPDHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF ProAI self-driving system, based on NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX technology, for automating package transportation and delivery, including the ""last mile"" of deliveries. Taking packages from a central point to their final destinations is considered the most complex and costliest aspect of courier and e-commerce deliveries.

DPDHL currently has a fleet of 3,400 StreetScooter electric delivery vehicles, which can be equipped with ZF's multiple sensors, including cameras, lidar and radar, that feed into the ZF ProAI system. This can enable the vehicle to use AI to understand its environment, plan a safe path forward, proceed along a selected route and park itself -- ensuring deliveries can be made with greater accuracy and safety, and at lower cost.

""The development of autonomous delivery vehicles demonstrates how AI and deep learning are also reshaping the commercial transportation industry,"" said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. ""As online shopping continues to explode, and the shortage of truck drivers becomes more dire, AI-enabled vehicles will be key to providing last-mile delivery services.""

""Research and development of ecological, economical and efficient transportation will bring dramatic changes to the logistics industry,"" said Jürgen Gerdes, member of the Board of Management at Deutsche Post AG. ""Partnering with NVIDIA and ZF will enable us to responsibly support this development, benefit from it and reinforce our position as the industry´s innovation leader.""

""In its StreetScooter fleet, Deutsche Post DHL is taking its next step with our current and future generation of surround sensor technology and ZF ProAI artificial intelligence brain powered by NVIDIA,"" said Stefan Sommer, CEO of ZF. ""ZF ProAI is the brain between our autonomous driving sensor set to detect and understand the environment, and our motion control based on outstanding mechanical competence -- the entire system follows our 'see - think - act' approach. In supply logistics and on the last mile where autonomous driving has tremendous benefits, goods can be delivered independent of the time of the day and delivery staff, with minimal noise and emissions, thus significantly reducing traffic congestion in city centers.""

To develop these AI delivery vehicles, DPDHL has already configured its data center with the NVIDIA DGX-1™ AI supercomputer for training its neural networks. It will then run its deep learning models on the truck's NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform. A prototype delivery vehicle unveiled today uses six cameras, one radar and two lidar -- all feeding into the NVIDIA DRIVE PX.

GTC Europe -- NVIDIA today unveiled the world's first artificial intelligence computer designed to drive fully autonomous robotaxis.

The new system, codenamed Pegasus, extends the NVIDIA® DRIVE™ PX AI computing platform to handle Level 5 driverless vehicles. NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus delivers over 320 trillion operations per second -- more than 10x the performance of its predecessor, NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2.

NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus will help make possible a new class of vehicles that can operate without a driver -- fully autonomous vehicles without steering wheels, pedals or mirrors, and interiors that feel like a living room or office. They will arrive on demand to safely whisk passengers to their destinations, bringing mobility to everyone, including the elderly and disabled.

Millions of hours of lost time will be recaptured by drivers as they work, play, eat or sleep on their daily commutes. And countless lives will be saved by vehicles that are never fatigued, impaired or distracted -- increasing road safety, reducing congestion and freeing up valuable land currently used for parking lots.

Of the 225 partners developing on the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform, more than 25 are developing fully autonomous robotaxis using NVIDIA CUDA GPUs. Today, their trunks resemble small data centers, loaded with racks of computers with server-class NVIDIA GPUs running deep learning, computer vision and parallel computing algorithms. Their size, power demands and cost make them impractical for production vehicles.

The computational requirements of robotaxis are enormous -- perceiving the world through high-resolution, 360-degree surround cameras and lidars, localizing the vehicle within centimeter accuracy, tracking vehicles and people around the car, and planning a safe and comfortable path to the destination. All this processing must be done with multiple levels of redundancy to ensure the highest level of safety. The computing demands of driverless vehicles are easily 50 to 100 times more intensive than the most advanced cars today.

""Creating a fully self-driving car is one of society's most important endeavors -- and one of the most challenging to deliver,"" said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. ""The breakthrough AI computing performance and efficiency of Pegasus is crucial for the industry to realize this vision.

""Driverless cars will enable new ride- and car-sharing services. New types of cars will be invented, resembling offices, living rooms or hotel rooms on wheels. Travelers will simply order up the type of vehicle they want based on their destination and activities planned along the way. The future of society will be reshaped,"" he said.

Broad Industry Support

Virtually all carmakers, transportation as a service companies, as well as startups are using NVIDIA AI in the development of Level 5 vehicles.

""NVIDIA gets it. And their DRIVE PX Pegasus will get us to Level 5.""

-- Tim Kentley-Klay, CEO and co-founder, Zoox

""We plan to put NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus into production in our autonomous vehicles.""

-- Sertac Karaman, president and co-founder, Optimus Ride

""The breakthrough AI performance and capabilities of the NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus platform will ensure the reliability and safety of our autonomous trucking fleet.""

-- Xiaodi Hou, CTO, TuSimple

""NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 is the brain of our self-driving prototypes, and we can't wait to get our hands on NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus.""

-- Dmitry Polischuk, head of self-driving, Yandex.Taxi

""NuTonomy is building for Level 5 and Pegasus is the kind of platform that will be required to support these types of systems.""

-- Karl Iagnemma, CEO and co-founder, NuTonomy

""Today dozens of companies are racing to develop robotaxis, but they are still gated by the massive computation needs of a truly driverless car,"" said Luca De Ambroggi, senior principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. ""The new NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus shows the path to production for the automakers, startups and automotive ecosystem working to deliver this amazing vision.""

Product Specifications

NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus is powered by four high-performance AI processors. It couples two of NVIDIA's newest Xavier system-on-a-chip processors -- featuring an embedded GPU based on the NVIDIA Volta architecture -- with two next-generation discrete GPUs with hardware created for accelerating deep learning and computer vision algorithms. The system will provide the enormous computational capability for fully autonomous vehicles in a computer the size of a license plate, drastically reducing energy consumption and cost.

Pegasus is designed for ASIL D certification -- the industry's highest safety level -- with automotive inputs/outputs, including CAN (controller area network), Flexray, 16 dedicated high-speed sensor inputs for camera, radar, lidar and ultrasonics, plus multiple 10Gbit Ethernet connectors. Its combined memory bandwidth exceeds 1 terabyte per second.

NVIDIA DRIVE PX Platform

The NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform scales from a single mobile processor configuration delivering Level 2+/Level 3 capabilities to a combination of multiple mobile processors and discrete GPUs for full Level 5. These configurations run on a single, open software architecture. This enables automakers and tier 1 suppliers to move from development into production for a wide range of self-driving solutions -- from AutoCruise on the highway, to AutoChauffeur for point-to-point travel, to Pegasus for a fully autonomous vehicle.

NVIDIA DRIVE PX is part of a broad family of NVIDIA AI computing solutions. Data scientists who train their deep neural networks in the data center on the NVIDIA DGX-1™ AI supercomputer can seamlessly run on NVIDIA DRIVE PX inside the vehicle. The unified architecture enables the same NVIDIA DRIVE software algorithms, libraries and tools that run in the data center also perform inferencing in the car.

This cloud-to-car approach enables cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.

Availability

Pegasus will be available to NVIDIA automotive partners in the second half of 2018. NVIDIA DriveWorks software and NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 configurations are available today for developers working on autonomous vehicles and algorithms. More information is available at www.nvidia.com/drive.

NVIDIA Tesla GPU accelerators provide the optimal inference solution -- combining the highest throughput, best efficiency and lowest latency on deep learning inference workloads to power new AI-driven experiences.

Inference for Self-Driving Cars and Embedded Applications

With NVIDIA's unified architecture, deep neural networks on every deep learning framework can be trained on NVIDIA DGX™ systems in the data center, and then deployed into all types of devices -- from robots to autonomous vehicles -- for real-time inferencing at the edge.

TuSimple, a startup developing autonomous trucking technology, increased inferencing performance by 30 percent after TensorRT optimization. In June, the company successfully completed a 170-mile Level 4 test drive from San Diego to Yuma, Arizona, using NVIDIA GPUs and cameras as the primary sensor. The performance gains from TensorRT allow TuSimple to analyze additional camera data, and add new AI algorithms to their autonomous trucks, without sacrificing response time.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2018 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 56356419. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA's conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, loss on early debt conversions, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SIGGRAPH - NVIDIA today announced that it is bringing the power of artificial intelligence to rendering with the launch of NVIDIA OptiX™ 5.0 SDK with powerful new ray-tracing capabilities.

Running OptiX 5.0 on the NVIDIA DGX Station™ -- the company's recently introduced deskside AI workstation -- will give designers, artists and other content-creation professionals the rendering capability of 150 standard CPU-based servers. This access to GPU-powered accelerated computing will provide extraordinary ability to iterate and innovate with speed and performance, at a fraction of the cost.

""Developers using our platform can enable millions of artists and designers to access the capabilities of a render farm right at their desk,"" said Bob Pette, Vice President, Professional Visualization, NVIDIA. ""By creating OptiX-based applications, they can bring the extraordinary power of AI to their customers, enhancing their creativity and dramatically improving productivity.""

OptiX 5.0's new ray tracing capabilities will speed up the process required to visualize designs or characters, dramatically increasing a creative professional's ability to interact with their content. It features new AI denoising capability to accelerate the removal of graininess from images, and brings GPU-accelerated motion blur for realistic animation effects.

OptiX 5.0 will be available at no cost to registered developers in November.

Rendering Appliance Powers AI Workflows

By running NVIDIA OptiX 5.0 on a DGX Station, content creators can significantly accelerate training, inference and rendering. A whisper-quiet system that fits under a desk, NVIDIA DGX Station uses the latest NVIDIA Volta-generation GPUs, making it the most powerful AI rendering system available.

To achieve equivalent rendering performance of a DGX Station, content creators would need access to a render farm with more than 150 servers that require some 200 kilowatts of power, compared with 1.5 kilowatts for a DGX Station. The cost for purchasing and operating that render farm would reach $4 million over three years compared with less than $75,000 for a DGX Station.

Industry Support for AI-based Graphics

NVIDIA is working with many of the world's most important technology companies and creative visionaries from Hollywood studios to set the course for the use of AI for rendering, design, character generation and the creation of virtual worlds. They voiced broad support for the company's latest innovations:

""AI is transforming industries everywhere. We're excited to see how NVIDIA's new AI technologies will improve the filmmaking process."" -- Steve May, Vice President and CTO, Pixar

""We're big fans of NVIDIA OptiX. It greatly reduced our development cost while porting the ray tracing core of our Clarisse renderer to NVIDIA GPUs and offers extremely fast performance. With the potential to significantly decrease rendering times with AI-accelerated denoising, OptiX 5 is very promising as it can become a game changer in production workflows."" -- Nicolas Guiard, Principal Engineer, Isotropix

""AI has the potential to turbocharge the creative process. We see a future where our artists' creativity is unleashed with AI -- a future where paintbrushes can truly 'think' and empower artists to create images and experiences we could hardly imagine just a few years ago. At Technicolor, we share NVIDIA's vision to chart a path that enhances the toolset for creatives to deepen audience experiences."" -- Sutha Kamal, Vice President, Technology Strategy, Technicolor

All 13 use NVIDIA Tesla P100 data center GPU accelerators, including four systems based on the NVIDIA DGX-1™ AI supercomputer.

NVIDIA today also released performance data illustrating that NVIDIA Tesla GPUs have improved performance for HPC applications by 3X over the Kepler architecture released two years ago. This significantly boosts performance beyond what would have been predicted by Moore's Law, even before it began slowing in recent years.

Additionally, NVIDIA announced that its Tesla V100 GPU accelerators -- which combine AI and traditional HPC applications on a single platform -- are projected to provide the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Summit supercomputer with 200 petaflops of 64-bit floating point performance and over 3 exaflops of AI performance when it comes online later this year.

NVIDIA GPUs Fueling World's Greenest Supercomputers

The Green500 list, released today at the International Supercomputing Show in Frankfurt, is topped by the new TSUBAME 3.0 system, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs. It hit a record 14.1 gigaflops per watt -- 50 percent higher efficiency than the previous top system -- NVIDIA's own SATURNV, which ranks No. 10 on the latest list.

Spots two through six on the new list are clusters housed at Yahoo Japan, Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan's Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN), the University of Cambridge and the Swiss National Computing Center (CSCS), home to the newly crowned fastest supercomputer in Europe, Piz Daint. Other key systems in the top 13 measured systems powered by NVIDIA include E4 Computer Engineering, University of Oxford, and the University of Tokyo.

Systems built on NVIDIA's DGX-1 AI supercomputer -- which combines NVIDIA Tesla GPU accelerators with a fully optimized AI software package -- include RAIDEN at RIKEN, JADE at the University of Oxford, a hybrid cluster at a major social media and technology services company and NVIDIA's own SATURNV.

""Researchers taking on the world's greatest challenges are seeking a powerful, unified computing architecture to take advantage of HPC and the latest advances in AI,"" said Ian Buck, general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. ""Our AI supercomputing platform provides one architecture for computational and data science, providing the most brilliant minds a combination of capabilities to accelerate the rate of innovation and solve the unsolvable.""

""With TSUBAME 3.0 supercomputer our goal was to deliver a single powerful platform for both HPC and AI with optimal energy efficiency as one of the flagship Japanese national supercomputers,"" said Professor Satoshi Matsuoka of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. ""The most important point is that we achieved this result with a top-tier production machine of multi-petascale. NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs allowed us to excel at both these objectives so we can provide this revolutionary AI supercomputing platform to accelerate our scientific research and education of the country.""

Volta: Leading the Path to Exascale

NVIDIA revealed progress toward achieving exascale levels of performance, with anticipated leaps in speed, efficiency and AI computing capability for the Summit supercomputer, scheduled for delivery later this year to the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Featuring Tesla V100 GPU accelerators, Summit is projected to deliver 200 petaflops of performance -- compared with 93 petaflops for the world's current fastest system, China's TaihuLight. Additionally, Summit is expected to have strong AI computing capabilities, achieving more than 3 exaflops of half-precision Tensor Operations.

""AI is extending HPC and together they are accelerating the pace of innovation to help solve some of the world's most important challenges,"" said Jeff Nichols, associate laboratory director of the Computing and Computational Science Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. ""Oak Ridge's pre-exascale supercomputer, Summit, is powered by NVIDIA Volta GPUs that provide a single unified architecture that excels at both AI and HPC. We believe AI supercomputing will unleash breakthrough results for researchers and scientists.""

Volta on Every Major Cloud

The extreme computing capabilities of the V100 GPU accelerators will be available later this year as a service through several of the world's leading cloud service providers. Companies that have stated their enthusiasm and planned support for Volta-based services include Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Tencent.

Volta: Ultimate Architecture for AI Supercomputing

To extend the reach of Volta, NVIDIA also announced it is making new Tesla V100 GPU accelerators available in a PCIe form factor for standard servers. With PCIe systems, as well as previously announced systems using NVIDIA NVLink™ interconnect technology, coming to market, Volta promises to revolutionize HPC and bring groundbreaking AI technology to supercomputers, enterprises and clouds.

Specifications of the PCIe form factor include:

7 teraflops double-precision performance, 14 teraflops single-precision performance and 112 teraflops half-precision performance with NVIDIA GPU BOOST™ technology

16GB of CoWoS HBM2 stacked memory, delivering 900GB/sec of memory bandwidth

Support for PCIe Gen 3 interconnect (up to 32GB/sec bi-directional bandwidth)

250 watts of power

NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU accelerators for PCIe-based systems are expected to be available later this year from NVIDIA reseller partner and manufacturers, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

""HPE is excited to complement our purpose-built HPE Apollo systems innovation for deep learning and AI with the unique, industry-leading strengths of the NVIDIA Tesla V100 technology architecture to accelerate insights and intelligence for our customers,"" said Bill Mannel, vice president and general manager of HPC and AI at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. ""HPE will support NVIDIA Volta with PCIe interconnects in three different systems in our portfolio and provide early access to NVLink 2.0 systems to address emerging customer demand.""

Max-Q, an integral part of NASA's mission to launch man into space, is defined as the point at which the aerodynamic stress on a rocket in atmospheric flight is maximized. Thus, the design of the rocket is precision-engineered around Max-Q. NVIDIA has applied a similar philosophy to designing gaming laptops, enabling OEMs to build laptops that are 3x thinner with up to 3x more performance of previous generation products.

The results: a high-performance gaming platform, that is as small as 18mm thick -- as thin as a MacBook Air -- with up to 70 percent more gaming performance than what is currently available.1

The Marvels of Max-Q

At the heart of this performance is NVIDIA Pascal™, the world's most efficient gaming GPU architecture. To deliver more performance to thin laptops, NVIDIA has further optimized and configured Pascal for even higher efficiency. And with Max-Q, everything in the design is precision engineered -- including the laptop, the GPU, the drivers, and the thermal and electrical components -- to ensure peak efficiency.

With its blend of rocket science and exacting design, Max-Q pushes PC gaming on laptops into another stratosphere:

Powerful GPUs at Max Efficiency: Based on the NVIDIA Pascal GPU architecture, GeForce® GTX 1080 is manufactured on the leading-edge FinFET 16nm process, and features cutting-edge GDDR5X memory. Max-Q combines a new way of operating the GPU for peak efficiency, with optimizations such as a low voltage optimized clock curve that wrings out gaming performance while reducing power.

NVIDIA today ushered in a new era for the robotics industry, introducing breakthroughs that radically simplify the work of building and training intelligent machines.

In his keynote at the eighth annual GPU Technology Conference, NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang introduced the NVIDIA Isaac™ robot simulator, which utilizes sophisticated video-game and graphics technologies to train intelligent machines in simulated real-world conditions before they get deployed. The company also introduced a set of robot reference-design platforms that make it faster to build such machines using the NVIDIA Jetson™ platform.

""Robots based on artificial intelligence hold enormous promise for improving our lives, but building and training them has posed significant challenges,"" Huang said. ""NVIDIA is now revolutionizing the robotics industry by applying our deep expertise in simulating the real world so that robots can be trained more precisely, more safely and more rapidly.""

At GTC, more than 50 companies from around the world are showing robots capable of a huge range of capabilities, all of which incorporate NVIDIA's Jetson platform, which enables fast, efficient processing of complex data on edge devices. They are capable of handling such critical tasks as search and rescue, elder support and industrial automation of tedious or potentially dangerous tasks.

NVIDIA Isaac Advances Training, Testing of Robots

Prior to deployment, robots must be extensively trained and tested. With physical prototypes, this can be expensive and impractical. Creating the complete environment a robot will interact with can be unsafe or very complex. Modeling all possible interactions between a robot and its surrounding environment can be highly time consuming.

The Isaac robot simulator advances these tasks by providing an AI-based software platform that lets teams train robots in highly realistic virtual environments and then transfer that knowledge to real-world units.

Isaac is built on an enhanced version of Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4 and uses NVIDIA's advanced simulation, rendering and deep learning technologies. Working within this virtual environment, developers can set up extensive test scenarios using deep learning training, and then simulate them in minutes -- which would otherwise take months to perform.

Once a simulation is satisfactorily complete, the information can be quickly transferred to real-world robots. Developers can then iterate and tweak the robot testing methodology, trading intelligence between the two environments. Since simulations within Isaac are highly realistic and can be performed quickly, fewer adjustments are needed to the final product compared to traditional development.

Jetson Reference Platforms Ease Training

To accelerate the development of advanced robotics on Jetson, NVIDIA partners are releasing open-source reference platforms for drones, submersibles, robots on wheels and other devices. These platforms provide building blocks for developers to easily create prototypes, helping reduce the time and money it takes to build robots from the ground up.

Among the companies releasing Jetson reference platforms are Toyota, for human support robots; Teal, for consumer drones; Enroute Lab, for industrial drones and unmanned surface and ground vehicles; and various universities and academia, for scale model autonomous cars.

Jetson Adopted Across Industries

Among the companies at GTC using Jetson are Fellow for industrial robots; Starship, Marble and Dispatch.AI for delivery robots; Enroute Lab and Aerialtronics for search and rescue drones; Toyota for human-support robots; and FIRST for high-school robotics programs.

NVIDIA today announced that it is collaborating with Toyota to deliver artificial intelligence hardware and software technologies that will enhance the capabilities of autonomous driving systems planned for market introduction within the next few years.

Toyota, one of the world's largest automakers, will use the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX AI car computer platform to power advanced autonomous driving systems planned for market introduction. Engineering teams from the two companies are already developing sophisticated software on NVIDIA's high-performance AI platform that will enhance the capabilities of Toyota vehicles, enabling them to better understand the massive volume of data generated by sensors on the car, and to handle the broad spectrum of autonomous driving situations.

""Toyota has worked on autonomous driving technologies for over 20 years with the aim of reducing traffic fatalities to zero as an ultimate goal, achieving smoother traffic, and providing mobility for all,"" said Ken Koibuchi, executive general manager at Toyota. ""Through this collaboration, we intend to accelerate the development of autonomous driving systems that are even more safe and capable.""

""We envision a future society where autonomous vehicles whisk people safely and comfortably around beautiful cities,"" said Jensen Huang, chief executive officer and founder of NVIDIA. ""The development of a self-driving car is one of the greatest technical challenges that's ever been tackled.

""We're combining breakthroughs in AI and high performance computing to build NVIDIA DRIVE PX, the brain of the autonomous car. Today's announcement with Toyota is the strongest indication that this autonomous future will soon become a reality,"" he said.

AI, and specifically deep learning, has become an important tool for the development of self-driving vehicles, particularly because of its ability to recognize and handle the nearly infinite number of scenarios encountered on the road.

Autonomous vehicles require an onboard supercomputer to process and interpret the data from all the sensors on the car. While many prototype vehicles contain a trunk full of computers to handle this complex task, the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform equipped with the next-generation Xavier processor will fit in your hand and deliver 30 trillion deep learning operations per second.

The DRIVE PX platform fuses data from cameras, lidar, radar and other sensors. The system can then use AI to understand the 360-degree environment surrounding the car, localize itself on an HD map and anticipate potential hazards while driving. In addition, the system software receives updates over the air, so the car can become smarter and smarter over time.

NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), a cloud-based platform that will give developers convenient access -- via their PC, NVIDIA DGX system or the cloud -- to a comprehensive software suite for harnessing the transformative powers of AI.

Speaking at the eighth annual GPU Technology Conference, NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang said that NGC will make it easier for developers to access the latest, optimized deep learning frameworks and the newest GPU computing resources.

""We're designing a cloud platform that will unleash AI developers, so they can build a smarter world,"" said Jim McHugh, vice president and general manager of DGX Systems at NVIDIA. ""You can do your best work no matter where you are, using our latest technology in the cloud. It's accelerated computing when and where you need it.""

Harnessing deep learning presents two challenges for developers and data scientists. One is the need to gather into a single stack the requisite software components -- including deep learning frameworks, libraries, operating system and drivers. Another is getting access to the latest GPU computing resources to train a neural network.

NVIDIA solved the first challenge earlier this year by combining the key software elements within the NVIDIA DGX-1™ AI supercomputer into a containerized package. As part of the NGC, this package, called the NGC Software Stack, will be more widely available and kept updated and optimized for maximum performance.

To address the hardware challenge, NGC will give developers the flexibility to run the NGC Software Stack on a PC (equipped with a TITAN X or GeForce® GTX 1080 Ti), on a DGX system or from the cloud.

NGC will accelerate and simplify deep learning development by making it easier for developers to conduct deep learning training, experimentation and deployment. Developers will be able to easily design more sophisticated neural networks, process more data, iterate quickly and get to market faster.

NGC will offer the following benefits:

Purpose Built: Designed for deep learning on the world's fastest GPUs.

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, revenue excluding Intel license, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, loss on early debt conversions, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

""The NVIDIA Metropolis platform enables customers to put AI behind every video stream to create smarter cities.""

Video Is World's Largest Data Source

Video is the world's largest generator of data, captured by hundreds of millions of cameras deployed in areas such as government property, public transit, commercial buildings and roadways. By 2020, the cumulative number of cameras is expected to rise to approximately 1 billion.

Humans currently monitor only a fraction of captured video, with most stored on disks for later review. Initial efforts at real-time video analytics techniques have proved far less reliable than human interpretation. Intelligent video analytics solves this challenge by using deep learning in cameras, on-premises video recorders and servers, and in the cloud to monitor video instantaneously with accuracy and scalability.

Metropolis spans multiple NVIDIA products that operate on a unified architecture.

High-performance deep learning inferencing happens at the edge with the NVIDIA Jetson™ embedded computing platform, and through servers and data centers with NVIDIA® Tesla® GPU accelerators. Rich data visualization is powered by NVIDIA Quadro® professional graphics. And the entire edge-to-cloud platform is supported by NVIDIA's rich software development kits, including JetPack, DeepStream and TensorRT™.

Growing AI City Partner Support

More than 50 NVIDIA AI city partners already help customers reveal insights and take real-time action using deep learning on NVIDIA GPUs. Among them are industry leaders such as Avigilon, Dahua, Hanwha Techwin, Hikvision and Milestone.

""With the fast-paced environment of a city, there are a near infinite number of activities taking place,"" said Dr. Mahesh Saptharishi, chief technology officer at Avigilon. ""We're excited by the potential of NVIDIA's Metropolis platform, as Avigilon continues to deliver AI-powered surveillance solutions and video analytics that focus users' attention on what matters most, in order to take action.""

""NVIDIA's end-to-end Metropolis platform can be applied to video streams to create smarter and safer applications for a variety of industries -- from transportation to commercial,"" said Shiliang Pu, president at Hikvision Research Institute. ""The benefit of GPU deep learning is that data can be analyzed quickly and accurately to drive deeper insights.""

""City management customers using Milestone's upcoming Video Processing Server with NVIDIA Metropolis are positioned to take the lead in the adoption of deep learning for video-enabled IoT devices,"" said Bjørn Skou Eilertsen, chief technology officer at Milestone Systems. ""Unleashing the value of this metadata will provide intelligent insights to take smart action.""

Providing hyperscale data centers with a fast, flexible path for AI, the new HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator is an open-source design released in conjunction with Microsoft's Project Olympus.

HGX-1 does for cloud-based AI workloads what ATX -- Advanced Technology eXtended -- did for PC motherboards when it was introduced more than two decades ago. It establishes an industry standard that can be rapidly and efficiently embraced to help meet surging market demand.

The new architecture is designed to meet the exploding demand for AI computing in the cloud -- in fields such as autonomous driving, personalized healthcare, superhuman voice recognition, data and video analytics, and molecular simulations.

""AI is a new computing model that requires a new architecture,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. ""The HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.""

""The HGX-1 AI accelerator provides extreme performance scalability to meet the demanding requirements of fast-growing machine learning workloads, and its unique design allows it to be easily adopted into existing data centers around the world,"" wrote Kushagra Vaid, general manager and distinguished engineer, Azure Hardware Infrastructure, Microsoft, in a blog post.

For the thousands of enterprises and startups worldwide that are investing in AI and adopting AI-based approaches, the HGX-1 architecture provides unprecedented configurability and performance in the cloud.

Powered by eight NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 GPUs in each chassis, it features an innovative switching design -- based on NVIDIA NVLink™ interconnect technology and the PCIe standard -- enabling a CPU to dynamically connect to any number of GPUs. This allows cloud service providers that standardize on the HGX-1 infrastructure to offer customers a range of CPU and GPU machine instance configurations.

Cloud workloads are more diverse and complex than ever. AI training, inferencing and HPC workloads run optimally on different system configurations, with a CPU attached to a varying number of GPUs. The highly modular design of the HGX-1 allows for optimal performance no matter the workload. It provides up to 100x faster deep learning performance compared with legacy CPU-based servers, and is estimated at one-fifth the cost for conducting AI training and one-tenth the cost for AI inferencing.

With its flexibility to work with data centers across the globe, HGX-1 offers existing hyperscale data centers a quick, simple path to be ready for AI.

Collaboration to Bring Industry Standard to Hyperscale

Microsoft, NVIDIA and Ingrasys (a Foxconn subsidiary) collaborated to architect and design the HGX-1 platform. The companies are sharing it widely as part of Microsoft's Project Olympus contribution to the Open Compute Project, a consortium whose mission is to apply the benefits of open source to hardware and rapidly increase the pace of innovation in, near and around the data center and beyond.

Sharing the reference design with the broader Open Compute Project community means that enterprises can easily purchase and deploy the same design in their own data centers.

GDC 2017 -- NVIDIA today announced GameWorks™ DX12, a collection of resources for game developers that will increase realism and shorten product cycles in titles designed using DirectX 12, Microsoft's API that unifies graphics and simulation.

These resources include updates to the NVIDIA GameWorks SDK for creating interactive cinematic experiences on PC games; updates to the NVIDIA VRWorks™ SDK for creating immersive virtual reality experiences; new developer tools; and a new Game Ready Driver.

Together, they provide developers with substantial performance gains, multiple new rendering and simulation effects, and other capabilities to help create games optimized for DirectX 12.

""We have invested over 500 engineering-years of work to deliver the most comprehensive platform for developing DirectX 12 games, including the world's most advanced physics simulation engine,"" said Tony Tamasi, senior vice president of content and technology at NVIDIA. ""These resources will ensure that GeForce gamers can enjoy the very best game experience on DirectX 12 titles, just as they have on DirectX 11 games.""

""NVIDIA's commitment to DirectX 12 is clear,"" said Cam McRae, technical director at the Coalition, developers of Gears of War 4. ""Having them onsite during the development of Gears of War 4 was immensely beneficial, and helped us to deliver a game that is fast, beautiful and stable.""

""NVIDIA creates stunning special effects that run in real time on a PC and provides them to game developers,"" said Hajime Tabata, division executive of Square Enix. ""A lot of the visual magic you see in video games today is a direct result of NVIDIA's work behind the scenes. They are providing an invaluable combination of source code, tools, technology and the engineering effort it takes to help developers implement them. The advancement that we are trying to create through this collaboration is not simply about an evolution in visual appearance, but also to use new technology to create new user experiences.""

GameWorks Physics Simulation Comes to DX12

The latest version of GameWorks builds on the over 2 million lines of documented code that are available to developers, providing them with a huge range of rendering and simulation effects. GameWorks technologies are currently used in more than 1,000 titles.

DirectX 12 introduced asynchronous compute, which unified graphics and simulation by allowing GPUs to run non-graphics workloads for effects such as post-processing, lighting and physics. But these effects are currently limited because most games can only allocate a few milliseconds to run these types of non-graphical simulations while still delivering smooth gameplay.

To maximize the efficiency of asynchronous compute for gaming effects, NVIDIA introduced the world's most advanced real-time physics simulation engine to DX12, with two technologies that take advantage of asynchronous compute:

NVIDIA Flow 1.0 -- a visual effects library that provides simulation and volume rendering of dynamic, combustible fluid, fire and smoke. Supports both DirectX 12 and 11.

NVIDIA FleX 1.1 -- a unified particle-based simulation technique for real-time visual effects. Supports DirectX 12 compute.

FleX and Flow are available immediately for free to registered developers.

GameWorks updates also include NVIDIA HairWorks 1.3, a library that enables developers to simulate and render realistic fur and hair for their games. Version 1.3 supports DirectX 12 and is also available immediately.

VRWorks Comes to DirectX 12

VRWorks includes APIs, libraries and features that enable headset and application developers to achieve a new level of immersion in VR. It has been updated to support DirectX 12 with better performance, lower latency and plug-and-play compatibility. It will be supported in the Unity 2017.1 beta, which ships this spring, and the Unreal Engine 4 game engines -- thus covering a majority of game development platforms.

World's Most Advanced DirectX 12 Developer Tools

NVIDIA also introduced several developer resources created to improve DirectX 12 game development, including:

NVIDIA Aftermath 1.0 -- a diagnostic utility that developers can use for analyzing DirectX 12 error reports.

Nsight™ Visual Studio Edition 5.3 -- a tool that lets developers debug and profile VR and DirectX 12 applications in real time. Includes support for the Oculus, OpenVR (HTC Vive) and DirectX 12 APIs.

PIX Plug-in -- PIX is a DirectX 12 debugging tool developed by Microsoft. NVIDIA collaborated with the Microsoft PIX team to expose NVIDIA GPU Performance Counters to PIX for Windows via a PIX Plug-in.

Game Ready Driver Optimized for DX12

NVIDIA also revealed an upcoming Game Ready Driver optimized for DirectX 12 games. The company refined code in the driver and worked side by side with game developers to deliver performance increases of up to 16 percent on average across a variety of DirectX 12 games, such as Ashes of the Singularity, Gears of War 4, Hitman, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Tom Clancy's The Division.(1)

Since the first launch of its Pascal™ architecture -- the world's most advanced DX12 GPU family, including the performance-leading GeForce GTX 1080 Ti® and GTX 1080 GPUs -- NVIDIA has continuously improved DX12 game performance through releases of Game Ready drivers. The drivers are timed with the release of the latest games by leading partners.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 52907909. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, loss on early debt conversions, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Speaking at the opening keynote at CES, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, joined on stage by Audi of America President Scott Keogh, said future Audi car models will use deep learning to tackle the complexities of driving.

The first phase of this new collaboration focuses on NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX, an AI platform for self-driving cars, which uses trained AI neural networks to understand the surrounding environment, and determine a safe path forward.

""NVIDIA is pioneering the use of deep learning AI to revolutionize transportation,"" said Huang. ""Audi's adoption of our DRIVE computing platform for AI cars will accelerate the introduction of next-generation autonomous vehicles, moving us closer to a future of higher driving safety and new mobility services.""

Keogh said: ""Audi drivers know the pinnacle of performance and technology. In our mutual pursuit for safer roads, the partnership between Audi and NVIDIA will expand to deep learning and artificial intelligence to bring higher automation onto the road more quickly.""

One of the highlights of CES 2017 will be demos of an Audi Q7 piloted driving concept. Passengers will be able to ride in the vehicle's back seat, with no one behind the wheel.

Outfitted with a DRIVE PX 2 and running NVIDIA DriveWorks software, the Q7 uses deep neural networks -- specifically, NVIDIA PilotNet, which recognizes and understands its changing environment while driving safely. The course will be modified during the demonstration, and features a variety of road surfaces, with and without lane markings, and a simulated construction zone requiring a detour.

In his keynote, Huang addressed how AI will anticipate the driver's needs -- driving to the office in the morning and home at night, automatically opening and closing the garage door, and adjusting the climate to the individual's preferences, as well as being able to understand and respond to requests in a natural conversational language.

NVIDIA and Audi first appeared together at CES seven years ago and announced a technology partnership that has steadily expanded. The results include the award-winning Audi MMI navigation and the Audi virtual cockpit, currently available across a wide range of the automaker's sedans, SUVs and sports cars. In the coming months, Audi will roll out its new A8, the world's first Level 3 automated vehicle with its Traffic Jam Pilot system, powered by zFAS, which integrates NVIDIA hardware and software.

GTC China -- NVIDIA today unveiled a palm-sized, energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computer that automakers can use to power automated and autonomous vehicles for driving and mapping.

The new single-processor configuration of the NVIDIA® DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform for AutoCruise functions -- which include highway automated driving and HD mapping -- consumes just 10 watts of power and enables vehicles to use deep neural networks to process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It will be deployed by China's Baidu as the in-vehicle car computer for its self-driving cloud-to-car system.

DRIVE PX 2 enables automakers and their tier 1 suppliers to accelerate production of automated and autonomous vehicles. A car using the small form-factor DRIVE PX 2 for AutoCruise can understand in real time what is happening around it, precisely locate itself on an HD map and plan a safe path forward.

""Bringing an AI computer to the car in a small, efficient form factor is the goal of many automakers,"" said Rob Csongor, vice president and general manager of Automotive at NVIDIA. ""NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 in the car solves this challenge for our OEM and tier 1 partners, and complements our data center solution for mapping and training.""

More than 80 automakers, tier 1 suppliers, startups and research institutions developing autonomous vehicle solutions are using DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX 2's architecture scales from a single mobile processor configuration, to a combination of two mobile processors and two discrete GPUs, to multiple DRIVE PX 2s. This enables automakers and tier 1s to move from development into production for a wide range of self-driving solutions -- from AutoCruise for the highway, to AutoChauffeur for point to point travel, to a fully autonomous vehicle.

The new small form-factor DRIVE PX 2 will be the AI engine of the Baidu self-driving car. Last week at Baidu World, in Beijing, NVIDIA and Baidu announced a partnership to deliver a self-driving cloud-to-car system for Chinese automakers, as well as global brands.

""Baidu and NVIDIA are leveraging our AI skills together to create a cloud-to-car system for self-driving,"" said Liu Jun, vice president of Baidu. ""The new, small form-factor DRIVE PX 2 will be used in Baidu's HD map-based self-driving solution for car manufacturers.""

NVIDIA DRIVE PX is part of a broad family of NVIDIA AI computing solutions. Data scientists who train their deep neural networks in the data center on the NVIDIA DGX-1™ can then seamlessly run on NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 inside the vehicle. The same NVIDIA DriveWorks algorithms, libraries and tools that run in the data center also run in the car.

This end-to-end approach leverages NVIDIA's unified AI architecture, and enables cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.

GTC China - NVIDIA today unveiled the latest additions to its Pascal™ architecture-based deep learning platform, with new NVIDIA® Tesla® P4 and P40 GPU accelerators and new software that deliver massive leaps in efficiency and speed to accelerate inferencing production workloads for artificial intelligence services.

Modern AI services such as voice-activated assistance, email spam filters, and movie and product recommendation engines are rapidly growing in complexity, requiring up to 10x more compute compared to neural networks from a year ago. Current CPU-based technology isn't capable of delivering real-time responsiveness required for modern AI services, leading to a poor user experience.

The Tesla P4 and P40 are specifically designed for inferencing, which uses trained deep neural networks to recognize speech, images or text in response to queries from users and devices. Based on the Pascal architecture, these GPUs feature specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations, delivering 45x faster response than CPUs1 and a 4x improvement over GPU solutions launched less than a year ago.2

The Tesla P4 delivers the highest energy efficiency for data centers. It fits in any server with its small form-factor and low-power design, which starts at 50 watts, helping make it 40x more energy efficient than CPUs for inferencing in production workloads.3 A single server with a single Tesla P4 replaces 13 CPU-only servers for video inferencing workloads,4 delivering over 8x savings in total cost of ownership, including server and power costs.

The Tesla P40 delivers maximum throughput for deep learning workloads. With 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance with INT8 instructions, a server with eight Tesla P40 accelerators can replace the performance of more than 140 CPU servers.5 At approximately $5,000 per CPU server, this results in savings of more than $650,000 in server acquisition cost.

""With the Tesla P100 and now Tesla P4 and P40, NVIDIA offers the only end-to-end deep learning platform for the data center, unlocking the enormous power of AI for a broad range of industries,"" said Ian Buck, general manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. ""They slash training time from days to hours. They enable insight to be extracted instantly. And they produce real-time responses for consumers from AI-powered services.""

Software Tools for Faster Inferencing

Complementing the Tesla P4 and P40 are two software innovations to accelerate AI inferencing: NVIDIA TensorRT and the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK.

TensorRT is a library created for optimizing deep learning models for production deployment that delivers instant responsiveness for the most complex networks. It maximizes throughput and efficiency of deep learning applications by taking trained neural nets -- defined with 32-bit or 16-bit operations -- and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operations.

NVIDIA DeepStream SDK taps into the power of a Pascal server to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 HD video streams in real time compared with seven streams with dual CPUs.6 This addresses one of the grand challenges of AI: understanding video content at-scale for applications such as self-driving cars, interactive robots, filtering and ad placement. Integrating deep learning into video applications allows companies to offer smart, innovative video services that were previously impossible to deliver.

Leap Forward for Customers

NVIDIA customers are delivering increasingly more innovative AI services that require the highest compute performance.

""Delivering simple and responsive experiences to each of our users is very important to us,"" said Greg Diamos, senior researcher at Baidu. ""We have deployed NVIDIA GPUs in production to provide AI-powered services such as our Deep Speech 2 system and the use of GPUs enables a level of responsiveness that would not be possible on un-accelerated servers. Pascal with its INT8 capabilities will provide an even bigger leap forward and we look forward to delivering even better experiences to our users.""

To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 47401500. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, legal settlement costs, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

NVIDIA today introduced NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060 GPUs for notebooks, now available worldwide, providing gamers with a quantum leap forward in performance and power efficiency on the world's fastest-growing gaming platform.(1)

Based on the NVIDIA Pascal™ GPU architecture, GTX-10 Series GPUs are manufactured on the leading-edge FinFET 16nm process, and have been crafted for performance and optimized for performance per watt. The award-winning Pascal architecture makes GTX 10-Series GPUs the ideal foundation for building notebook platforms that enable virtual reality to be experienced on the go.

Notebook manufacturers are using the GPUs inside potent portable gaming devices as thin as 18mm, as light as four pounds and equipped with cutting-edge technologies to deliver astounding performance at 120Hz and 4K gaming.

Amazing Performance, Exquisite Craftsmanship

NVIDIA Pascal-based GPUs represent the single largest generational performance jump in the history of gaming notebooks. Designs range from thin and light to desktop replacements. Performance for VR and PC gaming reaches levels never seen before in a mobile platform.

Compared with prior-generation Maxwell architecture-based GPUs, the new GTX 10-Series GPUs for notebooks deliver up to 75 percent more performance right out of the box. And with the Dual-FET power supply and multi-phased power controllers, they offer more than 3x the overclocking potential, for even faster performance.

New BATTERY BOOST Technology and G-SYNC Displays

The GTX 10-Series GPUs for notebooks also include support for the latest NVIDIA BATTERY BOOST™ technology, delivering up to 2x more battery life while gaming and ensuring significantly smoother gameplay when unplugged from the wall. And with NVIDIA G-SYNC™ technology, the best gaming displays are getting even better, marking the first time that 2500x1400 resolution and 120Hz displays are available in a notebook.

Bringing VRWorks and Ansel to Notebooks

Like all Pascal-based GPUs, the new GTX 10-Series GPUs for notebooks also support NVIDIA VRWorks™ technologies. This includes NVIDIA Simultaneous Multi-Projection technology, which can yield up to a 3x VR graphics performance improvement over previous-generation GPUs. This advancement allows notebook gamers to play VR games with higher levels of detail for a more realistic, immersive experience.

Simultaneous Multi-Projection technology is also being integrated into the world's biggest game engines, Unreal Engine and Unity. More than 30 games are already in development, including Unreal Tournament, Poolnation VR, Everest VR, Obduction, Adr1ft and Raw Data.

Also supported is NVIDIA Ansel technology, a powerful game-capture tool that allows gamers to explore, capture and share the artistry of gaming in ways never before possible. With Ansel, users can compose the gameplay shots they want, pointing the camera in any direction, from any vantage point within a gaming world. They can then capture 360° stereo photospheres for viewing with a VR headset or Google Cardboard. Mirror's Edge: Catalyst, Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and The Witness are the first games to ship with Ansel support, with more on the way soon.

Availability

Gaming notebooks equipped with the GTX 1080, GTX 1070 and GTX 1060 are now available from the world's leading notebook OEMs and system builders, including Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Clevo, EVGA, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Origin, Razer, Sager and XMG. Features, pricing and availability will vary.

The GeForce GTX 1060 is a fantastic upgrade for gamers who want to experience next generation gaming. Thanks to the efficiency of NVIDIA’s Pascal architecture, the GeForce GTX 1060 brings the performance of our previous flagship GeForce GTX 980 to every gamer, yet it consumes only 120 watts. It also supports all of Pascal’s new graphics features like Simultaneous Multi-Projection, so VR users can play immersive VR games with GeForce GTX 1060 and enjoy fluid frame rates.

NVIDIA today added the NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 to its Pascal™ family of gaming GPUs, complementing the GTX 1080 and 1070, which have set records for speed and power efficiency following their launch two months ago.

Like the entire Pascal architecture GPU lineup, and with a starting price of only $249, the GTX 1060 has been crafted for speed and optimized for performance per watt. Manufactured on the leading-edge FinFET 16nm process, the GTX 1060 delivers GTX 980-level performance and twice the energy efficiency in VR. It consumes only 120 watts of power while driving the latest VR and DirectX 11/12 PC games at blistering speeds.

The GTX 1060 features 1,280 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR5 memory running at 8Gbps and a boost clock of 1.7GHz, which can be easily overclocked to 2GHz for further performance. Across the top gaming titles, GTX 1060 is on average 15 percent faster and over 75 percent more power efficient than the closest competitive product at stock speeds.(1)

GTX 1060 for Every Gamer, Everywhere -- Starting at $249

GTX 1060 custom boards will be available starting July 19 from NVIDIA GeForce Partners, including ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gainward, Galaxy, Gigabyte, Innovision 3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and Zotac. The NVIDIA GeForce Partners represent a global network that will deliver GTX 1060 to gamers in 238 countries and territories. The MSRP will start at $249.

SMP Technology Integrated into Top Game Engines; More Than 30 Titles in Development

The GTX 1060 supports NVIDIA VRWorks™, a software developer kit that allows developers to intertwine what users see, hear and touch with the physical behavior of the environment -- convincing them that their virtual experience is real.

Included with VRWorks is NVIDIA Simultaneous Multi-Projection technology, which allows the GTX 1060 to seamlessly project a single image simultaneously to both eyes, yielding a 3x VR graphics performance improvement over previous generation GPUs. This allows GTX 1060 users to play VR games with higher levels of detail, without sacrificing performance or quality, for a more realistic, immersive experience.

Simultaneous Multi-Projection is being integrated into the world's biggest game engines, Unreal Engine and Unity. More than 30 games are already in development, including Unreal Tournament, Poolnation VR, Everest VR, Obduction, Adr1ft and Raw Data.

NVIDIA Ansel Integrated into 'Mirror's Edge: Catalyst' and 'Witcher 3'; Available this Month

The GTX 1060 also supports NVIDIA Ansel™ technology, a powerful game-capture tool that allows gamers to explore, capture and share the artistry of gaming in ways never before possible. With Ansel, users can compose the gameplay shots they want, pointing the camera in any direction, from any vantage point within a gaming world, and then capture 360-degree stereo photospheres for viewing with a VR headset or Google Cardboard.

Gamers will be able to experience Ansel for themselves with Mirror's Edge: Catalyst next week, and Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, later this month. Many more Ansel-enabled games are in development, including Epic Games' Fortnite, Paragon and Unreal Tournament; Cyan Worlds' Obduction; Thekla's The Witness; Boss Key Productions' Lawbreakers; Ubisoft's Tom Clancy's The Division; and the highly anticipated No Man's Sky from Hello Games.

VR Funhouse Available This Month on Steam, Adds GTX 1060 Support

NVIDIA VR Funhouse -- the company's VR carnival game -- will be available for free later this month from Valve's Steam digital distribution service. Developed on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4, VR Funhouse will work on GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060 GPUs and HTC Vive VR headsets. It will also be open sourced to developers and artists so they can create their own VR Funhouse attractions.

Special Limited Founder's Edition, Direct from NVIDIA

The GeForce GTX 1060 Founders Edition board -- designed and built by NVIDIA -- will be available starting July 19 for $299 at www.nvidia.com only. The GeForce GTX 1060 Founders Edition is crafted with premium materials and components, including a faceted die-cast aluminum body machine finished for strength and rigidity and a thermal solution designed to run cool and quiet.

Like the GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 Founders Edition boards, a dual-FETs power supply is used to improve power efficiency, along with a low impedance power delivery network and custom voltage regulators.

ISC16 - To meet the unprecedented computational demands placed on modern data centers, NVIDIA today introduced the NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 GPU accelerator for PCIe servers, which delivers massive leaps in performance and value compared with CPU-based systems.

Demand for supercomputing cycles is higher than ever. The majority of scientists are unable to secure adequate time on supercomputing systems to conduct their research, based on National Science Foundation data.1 In addition, high performance computing (HPC) technologies are increasingly required to power computationally intensive deep learning applications, while researchers are applying AI techniques to drive advances in traditional scientific fields.

The Tesla P100 GPU accelerator for PCIe meets these computational demands through the unmatched performance and efficiency of the NVIDIA Pascal™ GPU architecture. It enables the creation of ""super nodes"" that provide the throughput of more than 32 commodity CPU-based nodes and deliver up to 70 percent lower capital and operational costs.2

""Accelerated computing is the only path forward to keep up with researchers' insatiable demand for HPC and AI supercomputing,"" said Ian Buck, vice president of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. ""Deploying CPU-only systems to meet this demand would require large numbers of commodity compute nodes, leading to substantially increased costs without proportional performance gains. Dramatically scaling performance with fewer, more powerful Tesla P100-powered nodes puts more dollars into computing instead of vast infrastructure overhead.""

The Tesla P100 for PCIe is available in a standard PCIe form factor and is compatible with today's GPU-accelerated servers. It is optimized to power the most computationally intensive AI and HPC data center applications. A single Tesla P100-powered server delivers higher performance than 50 CPU-only server nodes when running the AMBER molecular dynamics code,3 and is faster than 32 CPU-only nodes when running the VASP material science application.4

Later this year, Tesla P100 accelerators for PCIe will power an upgraded version of Europe's fastest supercomputer, the Piz Daint system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center in Lugano, Switzerland.

""Tesla P100 accelerators deliver new levels of performance and efficiency to address some of the most important computational challenges of our time,"" said Thomas Schulthess, professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich and director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. ""The upgrade of 4,500 GPU-accelerated nodes on Piz Daint to Tesla P100 GPUs will more than double the system's performance, enabling researchers to achieve breakthroughs in a range of fields, including cosmology, materials science, seismology and climatology.""

The Tesla P100 for PCIe is the latest addition to the NVIDIA Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform. Key features include:

Unmatched application performance for mixed-HPC workloads -- Delivering 4.7 teraflops and 9.3 teraflops of double-precision and single-precision peak performance, respectively, a single Pascal-based Tesla P100 node provides the equivalent performance of more than 32 commodity CPU-only servers.

-- Delivering 4.7 teraflops and 9.3 teraflops of double-precision and single-precision peak performance, respectively, a single Pascal-based Tesla P100 node provides the equivalent performance of more than 32 commodity CPU-only servers. CoWoS with HBM2 for unprecedented efficiency -- The Tesla P100 unifies processor and data into a single package to deliver unprecedented compute efficiency. An innovative approach to memory design -- chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) with HBM2 -- provides a 3x boost in memory bandwidth performance, or 720GB/sec, compared to the NVIDIA Maxwell™ architecture.

Page Migration Engine for simplified parallel programming -- Frees developers to focus on tuning for higher performance and less on managing data movement, and allows applications to scale beyond the GPU physical memory size with support for virtual memory paging. Unified memory technology dramatically improves productivity by enabling developers to see a single memory space for the entire node.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA's executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at http://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2017 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (212) 231-2919; no password is required. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, per diluted share impact of certain charges, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, legal settlement costs, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, advanced healthcare contribution, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Per diluted share impact of certain charges is calculated as such charges, net of income tax, divided by GAAP diluted shares. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SAN JOSE, CA - GPU Technology Conference -- NVIDIA today announced that Pascal™ architecture-based NVIDIA® Tesla® GPU accelerators will power an upgraded version of Europe's fastest supercomputer, the Piz Daint system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) in Lugano, Switzerland. The upgrade is expected to more than double Piz Daint's speed, with most of the system's performance expected to come from its Tesla GPUs.

Piz Daint, named after a mountain in the Swiss Alps, currently delivers 7.8 petaflops of compute performance, or 7.8 quadrillion mathematical calculations per second. That puts it at No. 7 in the latest TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers. CSCS plans to upgrade the system later this year with 4,500 Pascal-based GPUs.

Pascal is the most advanced GPU architecture ever built, delivering unmatched performance and efficiency to power the most computationally demanding applications. Pascal-based Tesla GPUs will allow researchers to solve larger, more complex problems that are currently out of reach in cosmology, materials science, seismology, climatology and a host of other fields.

Pascal GPUs feature a number of breakthrough technologies, including second-generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) that delivers three times higher bandwidth than the previous generation architecture, and 16nm FinFET technology for unprecedented energy efficiency. For scientists with near infinite computing needs, Pascal GPUs deliver a giant leap in application performance and time to discovery for their scientific research.

The upgrade will enable CSCS scientists to do simulations, data analysis and visualizations faster and more efficiently. Piz Daint will be used to analyze data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the world's largest particle accelerator. The upgrade will also accelerate research on the Human Brain Project's High Performance Analytics and Computing Platform, which currently uses Piz Daint. The project's goal is to build neuromorphic computing systems that use the same principles of computation and cognitive architectures as the brain. The upgrade will also facilitate CSCS research in geophysics, cosmology and materials science.

""We are taking advantage of NVIDIA GPUs to significantly accelerate simulations in such diverse areas as cosmology, materials science, seismology and climatology,"" said Thomas Schulthess, professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich and director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. ""Tesla accelerators represent a leap forward in computing, allowing our researchers to solve larger, more complex problems that are currently out of reach in a host of fields.""

""CSCS scientists are using Piz Daint to tackle some of the most important computational challenges of our day, like modeling the human brain and uncovering new insights into the origins of the universe,"" said Ian Buck, vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. ""Tesla GPUs deliver a massive leap in application performance, allowing CSCS to push the limits of scientific discovery.""

Mars 2030 was developed using scientifically accurate satellite imagery and data gathered in years of exploration missions. It boasts a level of graphics fidelity that is only possible with NVIDIA® VRWorks™ technologies.

""One in a billion people alive today will get to visit Mars, so this is for the rest of us,"" said Zvi Greenstein, general manager of the GeForce business unit at NVIDIA. ""Mars 2030 is being created as a true to life experience, while aiming for the highest visual fidelity possible in VR today, something only NVIDIA technology can deliver.""

NASA is providing technical expertise to FUSION through a Space Act Agreement to make the first Mars surface VR experience based on actual operational and hardware concepts that the agency is currently studying. Mars 2030 incorporates VRWorks' Multi-Res Shading, which renders each part of an image to best suit the pixel density required by a headset. It also includes VR SLI, which can assign multiple GPUs to a specific eye to accelerate stereo rendering.

""As a part of FUSION's commitment to innovative storytelling, we are always looking for unique ways to take our audience to interesting places,"" said Julian Reyes, lead VR producer at FUSION. ""We are thrilled that NVIDIA's latest technologies, combined with what NASA has planned for the next frontier of space exploration, will allow us to push visual boundaries, convincing users that they are 141 million miles away from home on the surface of Mars.""

GTC attendees can experience the first mission in Mars 2030, an exploration of an enormous Martian lava tube, from April 4-7 in the San Jose Convention Center.

Expected to be commercially available in the fall, Mars 2030 is optimized for NVIDIA® GeForce® and Quadro® GPUs to give the environment an unparalleled level of authenticity.

""It's our passion for gaming that drives us to tackle the technical problems presented by real-time rendering and simulation,"" said Tony Tamasi, senior vice president of content and technology at NVIDIA. ""Our GameWorks technologies push the boundaries of what's possible in real time, enabling developers to ship their games with state of the art special effects and simulations.""

The three new GameWorks rendering techniques for lighting and shadows include:

NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting - an advanced lighting technique that simulates how light behaves as it scatters through the air and atmosphere. NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting was first introduced in the hit video game Fallout 4.

NVIDIA Hybrid Frustum Traced Shadows (HFTS) - an algorithm for drawing high-fidelity shadows that transition smoothly from hard shadows near the occluding object, to proper soft shadows in regions farther away. HFTS debuted in the hit video game Tom Clancy's The Division.

NVIDIA Voxel Accelerated Ambient Occlusion (VXAO) - NVIDIA's highest quality algorithm for real-time ambient occlusion, VXAO is a shading technique that adds depth and realism to any scene. It surpasses older techniques by calculating shadows in world-space using all scene geometry, as opposed to screen space techniques that can only shadow from geometry visible to the camera. VXAO debuted in the hit video game Rise of the Tomb Raider.

The pair of extensions to the NVIDIA® PhysX® library include:

NVIDIA PhysX-GRB - a new implementation of NVIDIA's popular PhysX rigid body dynamics SDK, which has been used in hundreds of games. This hybrid CPU/GPU physics pipeline improves performance by a factor of up to 6X for moderate to heavy simulation loads.

NVIDIA Flow - a computational fluid dynamics algorithm that simulates and renders combustible fluids such as fire and smoke. Unlike previous methods, Flow isn't limited to simulation of the fluids inside a bounding box.

NVIDIA makes source code for select GameWorks libraries available to developers via GitHub. Source code for NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting and NVIDIA's FaceWorks demo is available today. Source code for NVIDIA HairWorks, NVIDIA HBAO+ and NVIDIA WaveWorks will be available soon.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA's executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at http://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific Time (5 p.m. Eastern Time). To listen to the conference call, dial (212) 231-2927; no password is required. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, per diluted share impact of restructuring and other charges, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other charges, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Per diluted share impact of restructuring and other charges is calculated as restructuring and other charges, net of income tax, divided by GAAP diluted shares. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

One hundred autonomous Volvo XC90 SUVs equipped with the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 car computer will be deployed for public use in Sweden in 2017.

CES—Volvo Cars will use the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 deep learning- based computing engine to power a fleet of 100 Volvo XC90 SUVs starting to hit the road next year in the Swedish carmaker’s Drive Me autonomous-car pilot program, NVIDIA announced today.

Autonomous technology is an important contributor to Volvo's Vision 2020 -- its guiding principles for creating safer vehicles. This work has resulted in world-leading advancements in autonomous and semi-autonomous driving, and a new safety benchmark for the automotive industry.

""Our vision is that no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo by the year 2020,"" said Marcus Rothoff, director of the Autonomous Driving Program at Volvo Cars. ""NVIDIA's high-performance and responsive automotive platform is an important step towards our vision and perfect for our autonomous drive program and the Drive Me project.""

Volvo's Drive Me autonomous pilot program will equip the luxury cars with the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 engine, which uses deep learning to navigate the complexities of driving. The cars will operate autonomously on roads around Gothenburg, the carmaker's hometown, and semi-autonomously elsewhere.

""Volvo's Drive Me project is the ideal application of our DRIVE PX 2 engine and deep learning,"" said Rob Csongor, vice president and general manager of Automotive at NVIDIA. ""We are bringing years of work by thousands of NVIDIA engineers to help Volvo achieve its safety goals and move self-driving cars from Gothenburg to the rest of the globe.""

Recognizing Objects Beyond Reach of Human Algorithms

The NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 engine enables cars to utilize deep learning -- a form of artificial intelligence -- to recognize objects in their environment, anticipate potential threats and navigate safely. With 8 teraflops of processing power -- equivalent to 150 MacBook Pros -- it processes data from multiple sensors in real time, providing 360-degree detection of lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, signs and more, to enable a variety of autopilot functions.

Recent deep-learning breakthroughs have greatly enhanced computers' ability to perceive the outside world. Using vast amounts of data and processing power, they can write software to recognize complex objects at a level beyond the reach of human-coded algorithms.

Much deep learning work is powered by NVIDIA's supercomputing GPUs. For example, Microsoft and Google have used GPUs to create image-recognition systems that beat a well-trained human in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. And Microsoft researchers recently trained a deep neural net that beat a human in IQ tests.

Map Localization and Path Planning

For map localization and path planning, the system can compare real-time situational awareness with a known high-definition map, enabling it to plan a safe route and drive precisely along it, adjusting to ever-changing circumstances. DRIVE PX 2 will also perform other critical functions such as stitching camera inputs to create a complete surround-view of the car.

Because self-driving cars require massive computing resources to interpret the data from multiple sensors, most early prototypes have contained a trunk full of computers. In contrast, DRIVE PX 2, which carries out the same functions, is the size of a tablet.

CES—Accelerating the race to autonomous cars, NVIDIA today launched NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 – the world’s most powerful engine for in-vehicle artificial intelligence.

NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 allows the automotive industry to use artificial intelligence to tackle the complexities inherent in autonomous driving. It utilizes deep learning on NVIDIA's most advanced GPUs for 360-degree situational awareness around the car, to determine precisely where the car is and to compute a safe, comfortable trajectory.

""Drivers deal with an infinitely complex world,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and CEO, NVIDIA. ""Modern artificial intelligence and GPU breakthroughs enable us to finally tackle the daunting challenges of self-driving cars.

""NVIDIA's GPU is central to advances in deep learning and supercomputing. We are leveraging these to create the brain of future autonomous vehicles that will be continuously alert, and eventually achieve superhuman levels of situational awareness. Autonomous cars will bring increased safety, new convenient mobility services and even beautiful urban designs -- providing a powerful force for a better future.""

24 Trillion Deep Learning Operations per Second

Created to address the needs of NVIDIA's automotive partners for an open development platform, DRIVE PX 2 provides unprecedented amounts of processing power for deep learning, equivalent to that of 150 MacBook Pros.

Its two next-generation Tegra® processors plus two next-generation discrete GPUs, based on the Pascal™ architecture, deliver up to 24 trillion deep learning operations per second, which are specialized instructions that accelerate the math used in deep learning network inference. That's over 10 times more computational horsepower than the previous-generation product.

DRIVE PX 2's deep learning capabilities enable it to quickly learn how to address the challenges of everyday driving, such as unexpected road debris, erratic drivers and construction zones. Deep learning also addresses numerous problem areas where traditional computer vision techniques are insufficient -- such as poor weather conditions like rain, snow and fog, and difficult lighting conditions like sunrise, sunset and extreme darkness.

For general purpose floating point operations, DRIVE PX 2's multi-precision GPU architecture is capable of up to 8 trillion operations per second. That's over four times more than the previous-generation product. This enables partners to address the full breadth of autonomous driving algorithms, including sensor fusion, localization and path planning. It also provides high-precision compute when needed for layers of deep learning networks.

Deep Learning in Self-Driving Cars

Self-driving cars use a broad spectrum of sensors to understand their surroundings. DRIVE PX 2 can process the inputs of 12 video cameras, plus lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors. It fuses them to accurately detect objects, identify them, determine where the car is relative to the world around it, and then calculate its optimal path for safe travel.

This complex work is facilitated by NVIDIA DriveWorks™, a suite of software tools, libraries and modules that accelerates development and testing of autonomous vehicles. DriveWorks enables sensor calibration, acquisition of surround data, synchronization, recording and then processing streams of sensor data through a complex pipeline of algorithms running on all of the DRIVE PX 2's specialized and general-purpose processors. Software modules are included for every aspect of the autonomous driving pipeline, from object detection, classification and segmentation to map localization and path planning.

End-to-End Solution for Deep Learning

NVIDIA delivers an end-to-end solution -- consisting of NVIDIA DIGITS™ and DRIVE PX 2 -- for both training a deep neural network, as well as deploying the output of that network in a car.

DIGITS is a tool for developing, training and visualizing deep neural networks that can run on any NVIDIA GPU-based system -- from PCs and supercomputers to Amazon Web Services and the recently announced Facebook Big Sur Open Rack-compatible hardware. The trained neural net model runs on NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 within the car.

Strong Market Adoption

Since NVIDIA delivered the first-generation DRIVE PX last summer, more than 50 automakers, tier 1 suppliers, developers and research institutions have adopted NVIDIA's AI platform for autonomous driving development. They are praising its performance, capabilities and ease of development.

""Using NVIDIA's DIGITS deep learning platform, in less than four hours we achieved over 96 percent accuracy using Ruhr University Bochum's traffic sign database.

To listen to the conference call, dial (303) 223-2699; no password is required. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other charges, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company's Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SC15 - Today's list of the world's TOP500 supercomputers shows the extent to which accelerated systems are shaping the future of the industry.

TOP500 Highlights

One-third of FLOPS now powered by accelerators

NVIDIA Tesla GPUs sweep 23 of 24 new accelerated supercomputers

Tesla supercomputers growing at 48% CAGR over past five years

For the first time, more than 100 accelerated systems are on the list of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers, accounting for 143 petaflops, over one-third of the list's total FLOPS. NVIDIA® Tesla® GPU-based supercomputers comprise 70 of these systems -- including 23 of the 24 new systems on the list -- reflecting compound annual growth of nearly 50 percent over the past five years.

There are three primary reasons accelerators are becoming increasingly adopted for high performance computing.

First, Moore's Law continues to slow, forcing the industry to find new ways to deliver computational power more efficiently. Second, hundreds of applications -- including the vast majority of those most commonly used -- are now GPU accelerated. Third, even modest investments in accelerators can now result in significant increases in throughput, maximizing efficiency for supercomputing sites and hyperscale datacenters.

""One day, all supercomputers will be accelerated,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer at NVIDIA. ""Leading supercomputing sites around the world have turned to GPU-accelerated computing, reflected in today's TOP500 list. As the pace of discovery accelerates and researchers turn to computation, machine learning and visualization, we fully expect to see this trend increase.""

Many of the world's leading systems use NVIDIA Tesla accelerators, including the fastest supercomputers in 10 countries. These include: the fastest system in the U.S., Titan, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; the fastest system in Russia, Lomonosov 2, at Moscow State University; and the fastest system in Europe, Switzerland's Piz Daint, at the Swiss National Computing Center.

Moore's Law Slows

As the size of transistors approaches atomic scale, it has become increasingly difficult to improve microchip performance without disproportionately increasing power or cost. While the industry can no longer rely on performance doubling every 18 months, computational demands continue to increase sharply. This has led to the growing adoption of accelerators, which work alongside CPUs to boost the performance of scientific and technical applications.

Hundreds of HPC Applications Support GPU Accelerators

The Tesla Platform has grown steadily since 2008 in the number of supported scientific, engineering, data analytics and other applications, with 370 GPU-accelerated applications now available.

A new study by Intersect360 Research, a tech research firm, shows that nearly 70 percent of the 50 most widely used HPC applications -- and 90 percent of the top 10 -- support GPU accelerated computing. Among them are the ANSYS Fluent computational fluid dynamics application; the GROMACS molecular dynamics application; and now -- as announced separately today -- VASP, an atomistic simulation application used by researchers around the world to model the behavior of individual atoms at the electronic level.

One of the study's authors, Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research, said: ""Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point in HPC, with NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs as the leader in the market. The adoption of accelerators and availability of GPU-accelerated versions of top HPC codes have been steadily increasing.""

Improved Datacenter Throughput with GPUs

Supercomputing and hyperscale datacenters can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In the past, the steady progression of Moore's Law allowed them to upgrade with new CPUs to keep up with ever-increasing demand. That's no longer possible. With the advent of GPU-accelerated computing, these large datacenter investments can be extended with the addition of NVIDIA Tesla accelerators which boost throughput required to meet these demands.

NVIDIA today unveiled a credit-card sized module that harnesses the power of machine learning to enable a new generation of smart, autonomous machines that can learn.

The NVIDIA® Jetson™ TX1 module addresses the challenge of creating a new wave of millions of smart devices -- drones that don't just fly by remote control, but navigate their way through a forest for search and rescue; compact security surveillance systems that don't just scan crowds, but identify suspicious activity; and robots that don't just perform tasks, but tailor them to individuals' habits -- by incorporating capabilities such as machine learning, computer vision, navigation and more.

Jetson TX1 is the first embedded computer designed to process deep neural networks -- computer software that can learn to recognize objects or interpret information. This new approach to program computers is called machine learning and can be used to perform complex tasks such as recognizing images, processing conversational speech, or analyzing a room full of furniture and finding a path to navigate across it. Machine learning is a groundbreaking technology that will give autonomous devices a giant leap in capability.

With its 1 teraflops of performance -- comparable to the fastest supercomputer from 15 years ago -- Jetson delivers exceptional performance for machine learning, computer vision, GPU computing and graphics, while drawing very little power.

""Jetson TX1 will enable a new generation of incredibly capable autonomous devices,"" said Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of the Tegra business at NVIDIA. ""They will navigate on their own, recognize objects and faces, and become increasingly intelligent through machine learning. It will enable developers to create industry-changing products.""

Available as a module, Jetson TX1 is also built into a Developer Kit, which enables hobbyists and professionals to develop and test highly advanced autonomous devices. This makes it easy to transition from development to manufacturing and production.

Industry Support

Ovum Principal Analyst Michael Azoff said: ""Jetson TX1 is a significant advance in moving machine learning applications from research into the real world. It has uses that range from artificial intelligence-assisted robots, to advanced systems in automobiles, and to Internet of Things-connected intelligent machines. The ecosystem around Jetson will accelerate the transfer of AI from lab to real-world machines.""

Sertac Karaman, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ""NVIDIA's Jetson TX1 is so powerful and easy to use, we decided to base MIT's robotics systems and science course around it. Our students will use TX1 for embedded vision, stereo reconstruction and machine learning, so their scale racecars will be able to detect and avoid obstacles. I'm excited with the possibilities that Jetson offers.""

Jeff Bier, president of Berkeley Design Technology, Inc., said: ""Based on BDTI's independent analysis, the Jetson TX1 stands out in three respects. First, developing applications on the Jetson TX1 feels more like developing on a PC than like developing on a typical embedded board. Second, the JetPackTX1 installer makes it easy to install a system image on the board. Third, support for CUDA enables developers to use the GPU to accelerate their applications without having to delve into the complexities of GPU programming.""

NVIDIA today announced at the International Machine Learning Conference updates to its GPU-accelerated deep learning software that will double deep learning training performance.

The new software will empower data scientists and researchers to supercharge their deep learning projects and product development work by creating more accurate neural networks through faster model training and more sophisticated model design.

The NVIDIA® DIGITS™ Deep Learning GPU Training System version 2 (DIGITS 2) and NVIDIA CUDA® Deep Neural Network library version 3 (cuDNN 3) provide significant performance enhancements and new capabilities.

For data scientists, DIGITS 2 now delivers automatic scaling of neural network training across multiple high-performance GPUs. This can double the speed of deep neural network training for image classification compared to a single GPU.

For deep learning researchers, cuDNN 3 features optimized data storage in GPU memory for the training of larger, more sophisticated neural networks. cuDNN 3 also provides higher performance than cuDNN 2, enabling researchers to train neural networks up to two times faster on a single GPU.

The new cuDNN 3 library is expected to be integrated into forthcoming versions of the deep learning frameworks Caffe, Minerva, Theano and Torch, which are widely used to train deep neural networks.

""High-performance GPUs are the foundational technology powering deep learning research and product development at universities and major web-service companies,"" said Ian Buck, vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. ""We're working closely with data scientists, framework developers and the deep learning community to apply the most powerful GPU technologies and push the bounds of what's possible.""

DIGITS 2 - Up to 2x Faster Training with Automatic Multi-GPU Scaling

DIGITS 2 is the first all-in-one graphical system that guides users through the process of designing, training and validating deep neural networks for image classification.

The new automatic multi-GPU scaling capability in DIGITS 2 maximizes the available GPU resources by automatically distributing the deep learning training workload across all of the GPUs in the system. Using DIGITS 2, NVIDIA engineers trained the well-known AlexNet neural network model more than two times faster on four NVIDIA Maxwell™ architecture-based GPUs, compared to a single GPU.1 Initial results from early customers are demonstrating better results.

""Training one of our deep nets for auto-tagging on a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X takes about sixteen days, but using the new automatic multi-GPU scaling on four TITAN X GPUs the training completes in just five days,"" said Simon Osindero, A.I. architect at Yahoo's Flickr. ""This is a major advantage and allows us to see results faster, as well letting us more extensively explore the space of models to achieve higher accuracy.""

cuDNN 3 - Train Larger, More Sophisticated Models Faster

cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of mathematical routines for deep neural networks that developers integrate into higher-level machine learning frameworks.

cuDNN 3 adds support for 16-bit floating point data storage in GPU memory, doubling the amount of data that can be stored and optimizing memory bandwidth. With this capability, cuDNN 3 enables researchers to train larger and more sophisticated neural networks.

""We believe FP16 GPU storage support in NVIDIA's libraries will enable us to scale our models even further, since it will increase effective memory capacity of our hardware and improve efficiency as we scale training of a single model to many GPUs,"" said Bryan Catanzaro, senior researcher at Baidu Research. ""This will lead to further improvements in the accuracy of our models.""

cuDNN 3 also delivers significant performance speedups compared to cuDNN 2 for training neural networks on a single GPU. It enabled NVIDIA engineers to train the AlexNet model two times faster on a single NVIDIA GeForce® GTX TITAN X GPU.2

Availability

The DIGITS 2 Preview release is available today as a free download for NVIDIA registered developers. To learn more or download, visit the DIGITS website.

The cuDNN 3 library is expected to be available in major deep learning frameworks in the coming months. To learn more visit the cuDNN website.

The company estimates that it will recognize restructuring charges in the range of $100 million to $125 million, primarily during fiscal 2016. These charges will consist of severance and other employee termination benefits, tax expense items and other costs associated with the wind-down, if the company is unable to sell the modem operations.

The Icera wind-down or sale is expected to benefit non-GAAP operating expenses in the second half of the year and the company will carefully invest in its growth initiatives of deep learning, self-driving cars and gaming. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately flat with the previous year, excluding litigation costs, which are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as the company defends its intellectual property.

Capital Return

During the first quarter, NVIDIA paid $46 million in cash dividends and repurchased 2.4 million shares. As a result, it returned an aggregate of $99 million to shareholders.

It has announced a 15 percent increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.0975 per share, from $0.085 per share. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.0975 per share on June 12, 2015, to all stockholders of record on May 21, 2015.

It also has announced an increase in its intended return to shareholders in fiscal 2016 to $800 million from the previously stated $600 million, through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.

Further, the company's board of directors has extended the previously authorized repurchase program through December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion, for an aggregate of $2.00 billion available for repurchase.

NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 is as follows:

Revenue is expected to be $1.01 billion, plus or minus two percent.



GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.7 percent and 56.0 percent, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.



GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $474 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $425 million.



GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 23 percent and 21 percent, respectively, plus or minus one percent.



The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges, which are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million, primarily during fiscal 2016. These charges will consist of severance and other employee termination benefits, tax expense items and other costs associated with the wind-down, if the company is unable to sell the modem operations.



Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million to $45 million.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific Time (5 p.m. Eastern Time). To listen to the conference call, dial (303) 223-2696; no password is required. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter fiscal 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of our Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Project SHIELD combines the advanced processing power of NVIDIA Tegra® 4, breakthrough game-speed Wi-Fi technology and stunning HD video and audio built into a console-grade controller. It can be used to play on its own integrated screen or on a big screen, and on the couch or on the go.

Tegra 4 at Its Heart

At the core of Project SHIELD is the world's fastest mobile processor, the new NVIDIA Tegra 4, which delivers enormous power from its custom 72-core GeForce GPU and the first quad-core application of ARM's most advanced CPU core, the Cortex-A15. These, combined with its battery-saver core and energy-saving PRISM 2 technology, deliver hours of gameplay on a single charge.

Windows and Android Games

Windows and Android are the world's most successful computing platforms, with massive ecosystems of system and software developers. While not specifically designed for gaming, both open platforms have drawn gamers by the millions. Project SHIELD is designed to allow them to enjoy Android and Windows games in a new, exciting way.

Project SHIELD can instantly download Android games, including Android-optimized titles available on NVIDIA's TegraZone™ game store, which has already delivered more than 6 million downloads to gamers. It can also be used as a wireless game receiver to a nearby PC equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 GPU or higher.

Console-Grade Controller

Project SHIELD's ergonomic controller was built for the gamer who wants ultimate control and precision.

Retinal Gaming Display

Brilliant gameplay and video are provided by Project SHIELD's integrated 5-inch, 1280x720 HD retinal multitouch display, with 294 dpi. Plus, Tegra 4 with Direct Touch technology gives it touch responsiveness that is a more consistent, accurate and smooth-flowing touch input experience than a standard touch device.

Tuned Port, Bass Reflex Portable Speaker System

Deep, rich audio is critical for a great gaming experience. And Project SHIELD provides fidelity and dynamic range never before available on a portable device, through its custom, bass reflex, tuned port audio system -- with twice the low-frequency output of high-end laptops.

Project SHIELD can also access Android apps such as Hulu, Netflix and Slacker Radio, so users can enjoy their movies and music anywhere without expensive, clumsy wired or wireless speakers.

The NVIDIA GRID Platform enables the smooth, seamless interactive experience of a high-performance gaming PC anywhere, on any screen -- including smart TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones.

NVIDIA GRID is a server designed to concurrently serve up to 36 times more HD-quality game streams than first-generation cloud-gaming systems, while reducing lag. It is fully integrated with a high density of NVIDIA® GPUs, specialized graphics-application streaming software and NVIDIA® VGX™ Hypervisor technology, which allows multiple users to share a GPU.

Initial partners on the NVIDIA GRID Platform include Agawi (United States); Cloud Union (China); Cyber Cloud Technologies (China); G-cluster Global (Japan); Playcast Media Systems (Israel); and Ubitus (Taiwan).

""By using the NVIDIA GRID Platform, our partners will allow gamers to play anywhere, anytime, without being tethered to a box,"" said Phil Eisler, general manager of cloud gaming at NVIDIA. ""The world's most exciting games can now be played as easily as you can stream a movie, right onto your TV or mobile device. No more discs to shuffle or files to download and install. Just click and play.""

Densest GPU Architecture, Broadest Compatibility, Best Interactivity

Consumers already enjoy the benefits of cloud computing to store email and photos and to stream music and movies. The NVIDIA GRID Platform builds on this capability by moving high-end gaming to the cloud, eliminating the need for consumers to manage game discs or fit game consoles next to flat-screen TVs.

The NVIDIA GRID Platform delivers three key attributes:

Densest GPU system architecture: NVIDIA GRID provides the highest number of concurrent, interactive data streams by using multi-GPU servers and sophisticated NVIDIA VGX GPU-sharing technology. Each server can deliver up to 36 game streams.





Broadest compatibility and scalability: NVIDIA GRID software and drivers enable interactive streaming of the widest range of games -- from casual games using low-graphics capabilities with a high density of streams, to high-performance titles requiring high-graphics capabilities.





Best interactivity: NVIDIA GRID delivers streamed content for seamless interaction without noticeable lag or latency. NVIDIA GRID technology reduces game server latency by up to 30 milliseconds compared to prior solutions, which effectively hides the network delivery time. Game play from an NVIDIA GRID server feels like that from a console next to a TV.





Partner Enthusiasm for NVIDIA GRID Platform

Six companies in the newly emerging cloud-gaming services arena are engaged in offering services based on the NVIDIA GRID Platform:

""Consumers love the convenience of any game anywhere instantly, and therefore cloud gaming is the natural evolution of the gaming experience. NVIDIA GRID is a fantastic tool that gives cloud service providers the improved density to make true-GPU clouds a reality and allows our operator, publisher and developer partners to reimagine the gaming experience using the Agawi CloudPlay platform.""

-- Rajat Gupta, co-founder of Agawi, which provides B-B cloud-gaming solutions for tablets and TVs.

""In China we don't have game consoles. And therefore we see a large opportunity for cloud gaming in China. The NVIDIA GRID technology is the best that we have seen for delivering high densities of HD-quality game streams to subscribers.""

-- Danny Deng, chief executive of Cloud Union, which provides cloud-gaming through China's Telecom/Unicom IPTV network.

""At Cyber Cloud, we focus on delivering cloud gaming services through existing set-top boxes using video-on-demand channels. With NVIDIA's GRID platform we can deliver large numbers of games-on-demand channels to China's digital TV subscribers.""

-- Jian Han, general manager of Cyber Cloud, a subsidiary of Beijing Novel-Supertv Digital TV Technology Co. ( NYSE : STV ), which provides cloud gaming through digital cable TV and IPTV networks.

""As the pioneer in cloud gaming, G-cluster is always looking for ways to increase the performance of our service. G-cluster is working with NVIDIA to reduce the costs for our IPTV operators and improve the experience for our subscribers around the world.""

-- Erik Piehl, president of G-cluster, which provides a white-label cloud-based gaming service through France's SFR and Orange.

""Cloud gaming is taking off. NVIDIA GRID technology, Smart Connected TVs and Playcast Media will serve as cloud gaming's catalyst, fueling its explosive growth in 2013.""

-- Guy de Beer, chief executive of Playcast Media, which provides a cloud-gaming service to more than 1.2 million subscribers through France's Bouygues Telecom, Korea's CJ Hellovision and Portugal Telecom.

""Ubitus is pleased to partner with NVIDIA to bring the world's most scalable cloud gaming systems to market. Ubitus is the leader in providing cloud gaming over fixed and wireless 4G networks, empowering telecom/cable service providers, hardware OEMs and game developers to benefit from cloud gaming opportunities in a truly sustainable manner.""

-- Wesley Kuo, CEO of Ubitus, which provides a cloud-based gaming service through Japan's NTT Docomo, Korea's LGU+ and USA's Verizon.

NVIDIA GRID Cloud Gaming Demonstrated Directly to LG Smart TV at CES

At next week's 2013 International CES event, NVIDIA will demonstrate the NVIDIA GRID Platform streaming games to an LG 55LA6900 Smart TV at 1080p resolution. Among the high-performance games that will be shown are ""Assassin's Creed III"" by Ubisoft.

""LG is very impressed by the capabilities of NVIDIA's GRID Platform to deliver high-quality game streams directly to LG Smart TVs without a game console,"" said Bae-Geun Kang, vice president, head of Software Development Group, TV Research Lab, LG. ""The NVIDIA GRID Cloud Gaming experience on an LG 55LA6900 Smart TV is beautiful to watch, easy to use and fun to play. It is just like Netflix for games.""

The NVIDIA GRID Platform enables the smooth, seamless interactive experience of a high-performance gaming PC anywhere, on any screen -- including smart TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones.

NVIDIA GRID is a server designed to concurrently serve up to 36 times more HD-quality game streams than first-generation cloud-gaming systems, while reducing lag. It is fully integrated with a high density of NVIDIA® GPUs, specialized graphics-application streaming software and NVIDIA® VGX™ Hypervisor technology, which allows multiple users to share a GPU.

Initial partners on the NVIDIA GRID Platform include Agawi (United States); Cloud Union (China); Cyber Cloud Technologies (China); G-cluster Global (Japan); Playcast Media Systems (Israel); and Ubitus (Taiwan).

""By using the NVIDIA GRID Platform, our partners will allow gamers to play anywhere, anytime, without being tethered to a box,"" said Phil Eisler, general manager of cloud gaming at NVIDIA. ""The world's most exciting games can now be played as easily as you can stream a movie, right onto your TV or mobile device. No more discs to shuffle or files to download and install. Just click and play.""

Densest GPU Architecture, Broadest Compatibility, Best Interactivity

Consumers already enjoy the benefits of cloud computing to store email and photos and to stream music and movies. The NVIDIA GRID Platform builds on this capability by moving high-end gaming to the cloud, eliminating the need for consumers to manage game discs or fit game consoles next to flat-screen TVs.

The NVIDIA GRID Platform delivers three key attributes:

Densest GPU system architecture: NVIDIA GRID provides the highest number of concurrent, interactive data streams by using multi-GPU servers and sophisticated NVIDIA VGX GPU-sharing technology. Each server can deliver up to 36 game streams.





Broadest compatibility and scalability: NVIDIA GRID software and drivers enable interactive streaming of the widest range of games -- from casual games using low-graphics capabilities with a high density of streams, to high-performance titles requiring high-graphics capabilities.





Best interactivity: NVIDIA GRID delivers streamed content for seamless interaction without noticeable lag or latency. NVIDIA GRID technology reduces game server latency by up to 30 milliseconds compared to prior solutions, which effectively hides the network delivery time. Game play from an NVIDIA GRID server feels like that from a console next to a TV.





Partner Enthusiasm for NVIDIA GRID Platform

Six companies in the newly emerging cloud-gaming services arena are engaged in offering services based on the NVIDIA GRID Platform:

""Consumers love the convenience of any game anywhere instantly, and therefore cloud gaming is the natural evolution of the gaming experience. NVIDIA GRID is a fantastic tool that gives cloud service providers the improved density to make true-GPU clouds a reality and allows our operator, publisher and developer partners to reimagine the gaming experience using the Agawi CloudPlay platform.""

-- Rajat Gupta, co-founder of Agawi, which provides B-B cloud-gaming solutions for tablets and TVs.

""In China we don't have game consoles. And therefore we see a large opportunity for cloud gaming in China. The NVIDIA GRID technology is the best that we have seen for delivering high densities of HD-quality game streams to subscribers.""

-- Danny Deng, chief executive of Cloud Union, which provides cloud-gaming through China's Telecom/Unicom IPTV network.

""At Cyber Cloud, we focus on delivering cloud gaming services through existing set-top boxes using video-on-demand channels. With NVIDIA's GRID platform we can deliver large numbers of games-on-demand channels to China's digital TV subscribers.""

-- Jian Han, general manager of Cyber Cloud, a subsidiary of Beijing Novel-Supertv Digital TV Technology Co. ( NYSE : STV ), which provides cloud gaming through digital cable TV and IPTV networks.

""As the pioneer in cloud gaming, G-cluster is always looking for ways to increase the performance of our service. G-cluster is working with NVIDIA to reduce the costs for our IPTV operators and improve the experience for our subscribers around the world.""

-- Erik Piehl, president of G-cluster, which provides a white-label cloud-based gaming service through France's SFR and Orange.

""Cloud gaming is taking off. NVIDIA GRID technology, Smart Connected TVs and Playcast Media will serve as cloud gaming's catalyst, fueling its explosive growth in 2013.""

-- Guy de Beer, chief executive of Playcast Media, which provides a cloud-gaming service to more than 1.2 million subscribers through France's Bouygues Telecom, Korea's CJ Hellovision and Portugal Telecom.

""Ubitus is pleased to partner with NVIDIA to bring the world's most scalable cloud gaming systems to market. Ubitus is the leader in providing cloud gaming over fixed and wireless 4G networks, empowering telecom/cable service providers, hardware OEMs and game developers to benefit from cloud gaming opportunities in a truly sustainable manner.""

-- Wesley Kuo, CEO of Ubitus, which provides a cloud-based gaming service through Japan's NTT Docomo, Korea's LGU+ and USA's Verizon.

NVIDIA GRID Cloud Gaming Demonstrated Directly to LG Smart TV at CES

At next week's 2013 International CES event, NVIDIA will demonstrate the NVIDIA GRID Platform streaming games to an LG 55LA6900 Smart TV at 1080p resolution. Among the high-performance games that will be shown are ""Assassin's Creed III"" by Ubisoft.

""LG is very impressed by the capabilities of NVIDIA's GRID Platform to deliver high-quality game streams directly to LG Smart TVs without a game console,"" said Bae-Geun Kang, vice president, head of Software Development Group, TV Research Lab, LG. ""The NVIDIA GRID Cloud Gaming experience on an LG 55LA6900 Smart TV is beautiful to watch, easy to use and fun to play. It is just like Netflix for games.""

Delivering truly game-changing performance for the most demanding PC games played at the gamer's preferred resolution of 1080p, the GTX 660 Ti is a dramatic upgrade for anyone playing on previous-generation graphics technology. The GTX 660 Ti is 41 percent faster on average than the GTX 560 Ti from 2011, and 58 percent faster on average than the GTX 470 from 2010.(1)

In addition to providing impressive performance, the GTX 660 Ti is filled with features, such as full support for DirectX 11 tessellation, TXAA, and PhysX® technologies and the ability to drive a 3+1 display configuration from a single card.

Factor in the Kepler architecture's great efficiency and low thermal design power and the GTX 660 Ti assures gamers of having the most stable, quiet and power-efficient gaming experience possible in its price class. The GTX 660 Ti even keeps pace in performance with competing products that cost $50 more, while consuming up to 25 percent less power(2), a testament to the efficiency of the streaming multiprocessor built inside each Kepler chip.

These power savings come into sharp relief when two GTX 660 Ti cards are paired together in SLI mode, delivering performance that outpaces the competition by up to 21 percent.

For a limited time, gamers who purchase a GTX 660 Ti GPU from a participating retailer or e-tailer will receive a voucher for a free copy of Gearbox Software's Borderlands 2, which is launching next month. Borderlands 2 is on track to be one of this year's most popular PC titles and includes support for PhysX technology for a totally immersive gaming experience.

The GTX 660 Ti is built using NVIDIA's 28-nanometer Kepler architecture, as are the GTX 680, GTX 670 and dual-GPU GTX 690, all of which were introduced earlier this year.

Approximately 450 ILM artists located in San Francisco and Singapore worked on Rango, each on a workstation equipped with NVIDIA Quadro solutions. The artists benefited from the speed of the graphics processing unit (GPU) when using animation tools such as Autodesk Maya, along with a range of ILM's in-house applications.

""Whenever you're approaching a film of this scale you need to make your production pipeline operate as efficiently as possible -- especially when it comes to character animation work,"" said Tim Alexander, VFX supervisor for Rango. ""By using NVIDIA Quadro processors and building GPU-accelerated processes into our workflow, we saved a huge amount of rendering time.""

ILM's proprietary GPU-accelerated fluid solver/renderer ""Plume"" has been used on several films, including Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Last Airbender. For Rango, new shadow and lighting features were built into Plume to make dust and fire simulations more realistic, contributing to the unique look of the environments envisioned for the film.

Alexander explains, ""If we have a character standing in the key light, he'll actually cast a shadow into the dust, smoke or fire. In the past we would fake those biometric ray-type effects or any sort of shading in the composite phase. By using the GPU to bake shadows and lighting into the simulation, we saved a tremendous amount of time and achieved a more realistic effect by having all of the detail of the object that's casting the shadow actually in the shadow itself.""

Plume was also used to simulate fire; in one scene, the main character Rango belches flames, setting a saloon patron ablaze. ""With NVIDIA GPU acceleration in Plume, we're getting real-time feedback on dust and fire. Previously it would have taken one or two days to simulate the same scene,"" continued Alexander.

Rango's crowd scenes feature up to 120 variations of 75 key characters -- each one with either hair, fur or feathers on their body. In order to accommodate the massive amounts of rendering required to generate the frames, ILM developed a GPU-accelerated process to calculate lighting occlusion. The occlusion data provided a preview of hair or feathers, and was fed into Pixar's RenderMan renderer for a final pass. The pipeline shortcut resulted in speed increases of up to 100 times, depending on how complicated the hair or feathers were within a given sequence.

Furthermore, the hundreds of GPU cores in each artist's workstation also boosted the performance of ILM's GPU render farm during off-business hours. With ""ObaQ,"" ILM's Academy Award-winning render queue system, NVIDIA processors were automatically utilized by the render system when an artist logged out at the end of the workday.

""Our ongoing work with ILM to drive GPU optimization for visual effects and CG creation has led to incredible results,"" said Dominick Spina, technology manager, Digital Film Group, NVIDIA. ""ILM's growing GPU integration and the dramatic impact it has made on their workflow ultimately benefits filmgoers, who continue to be delighted by ILM's innovative visual effects.""

The first fully animated feature film by ILM, Rango was released in theaters on March 4, 2011 and rocketed to the top box office spot in its opening weekend. In addition to the host of GPU-accelerated tools ILM developed to meet the demands of this film, they're currently developing new GPU-based toolsets in their upcoming productions.

The pulsar, originally discovered in July 2010, is identified as PSR J1952+2630. It measures about 15 kilometers in diameter and is located more than 30,000 light years from Earth, where it orbits a companion star that weighs about the same as the Sun. It is hoped that this discovery will enable scientists to learn more about the process of stellar evolution and how matter behaves at very high densities.

The Einstein@Home project uses spare computing power donated by hundreds of thousands of PC users all over the world to search data from gravitational wave detectors and radio telescopes. The newly released version of its software leverages NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs to get a 20X boost in performance -- as a result, just 10% of the GPUs that connect to the project daily could deliver the equivalent processing power of all the contributing CPUs.

More than two million machines have been signed up to participate in Einstein@Home since its launch in 2005, and some 100,000 systems contact the servers each week. If the computational power generated by the project were counted as a single system, it would be ranked among the 20 fastest supercomputers in the world.

The creation of project director, Prof. Bruce Allen, who is also director of the Max Planck Institute of Gravitational Physics, in Hannover, Germany, Einstein@Home is considered by many to be one of the most important, and most efficient, scientific experiments in the world.

""The growing importance of GPUs in Einstein@Home has radio astronomers enormously excited. They are enabling us to analyze, in one month, data that would have taken conventional processors a year to work through,"" said Allen. ""It's a dramatic change and eventually I could imagine that GPUs will contribute around 90% of the project's computational science with CPUs contributing the remainder.""

The free app delivers a curated selection of Tegra processor-optimized games, as well as professional game reviews, high-res screenshots, HD video trailers, gameplay videos and behind-the-scenes featurettes. Sale and delivery of users' selected games are completed using Google's Android Market.

Games on Tegra Zone apps are especially enhanced for Tegra 2 super chip-powered devices, and are more realistic and interactive. Among those selected as launch titles are Dungeon Defenders: First Wave Deluxe HD, the first game available for Android that's built on Unreal Engine 3; Samurai II: Vengeance; and Galaxy on Fire 2 THD. A complete list is provided below.

Introduced over the past several months in a variety of super phones and tablets, the Tegra 2 super chip is finding a growing market, particularly among those interested in console-quality gaming on their mobile device. It is built with the world's first mobile dual-core CPU -- which unleashes the best Web experience, with up two-times faster browsing and support for full Adobe® Flash® Player hardware GPU acceleration, plus unprecedented multitasking capabilities. It also includes an NVIDIA GeForce® GPU -- which provides stunningly rich visual experiences and console-quality gaming.

Tegra Zone Highlights:

The first Tegra super chip-enhanced games include:

Samurai II: Vengeance, by MADFINGER Games: A hack-and-slash action game with stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay. On par with console 3D brawlers, Samurai II: Vengeance takes advantage of the raw processing power of Tegra 2 with four times more texture resolution on characters, increased geometry for more realism, and completely redesigned knockdown moves.

Dungeon Defenders: First Wave Deluxe HD, by Trendy Entertainment: Combines the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building, in a beautifully stylized cartoon fantasy setting. The Tegra-enhanced version includes dynamic lighting schemes and advanced post-processing effects, as well as the same number of maps and game play levels on PC and Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) versions. Due to the graphics capabilities of the Tegra 2 processor, players can join in multiplayer, cross-platform games across super phones, tablets, PCs and the PS3.

Galaxy on Fire 2 THD, by Fishlabs: Epic sci-fi adventure with spectacular action, compelling story and a free gameplay unparalleled in depth and complexity, available for the first time on Android. The Tegra super chip-enhanced version renders the action at a consistently smooth frame rate, and includes more detailed spaceships with much higher quality textures.

Backbreaker THD, by Natural Motion: An intense, arcade football experience that looks even better and is more interactive when enhanced on a Tegra 2 processor. This version features high-quality textures on the characters, field and stadium and more rendered content, such as real-time action replay on the ""Jumbotron"" scoreboard. Also look for realistic shadow effects and dynamic lighting effects such as lens flares.

Fruit Ninja THD, by Halfbrick Studios: A juicy action game with squishy, splatty and satisfying fruit carnage. The Tegra 2 super chip-enhanced version is the definitive version of the best-selling game and adds special graphic detail and effects, including smoother edges on the fruit models, more geometry and realistic shading and lighting.

Vendetta Online, by Guild Software: 3D space combat, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that permits thousands of players to interact as the pilots of spaceships in a vast universe, available for the first time on a mobile device. The Tegra super chip-enhanced version is the first cross-platform space MMO and allows gamers to play against PC players and other mobile players in the same universe.

Monster Madness, by SouthPeak Games: A top-down action/shooting game where players fight off the monster invasion in four-player melee action. This game takes advantage of NVIDIA PhysX® technology for realistic in-game physics effects. The Tegra processor-enhanced version is graphically identical to the console version in every way.

Hardwood Solitaire IV, by Silver Creek Entertainment: A beautiful rendition of 10 classic solitaire games. Ported from the PC and Xbox 360 versions, the Tegra 2 super chip version incorporates real-time lighting and shadows in their game environments and adds new 1080p high-resolution textures for the card faces and backs.

NVIDIA has worked closely with game developers to enhance games for the Tegra 2 super chip, bringing such features as:

More realism: Increased geometry detail, higher resolution textures and complex shaders, lighting, and shadows

More interactivity: Larger number of characters on screen and more instances of independent animations

The free app delivers a curated selection of Tegra processor-optimized games, as well as professional game reviews, high-res screenshots, HD video trailers, gameplay videos and behind-the-scenes featurettes. Sale and delivery of users' selected games are completed using Google's Android Market.

Games on Tegra Zone apps are especially enhanced for Tegra 2 super chip-powered devices, and are more realistic and interactive. Among those selected as launch titles are Dungeon Defenders: First Wave Deluxe HD, the first game available for Android that's built on Unreal Engine 3; Samurai II: Vengeance; and Galaxy on Fire 2 THD. A complete list is provided below.

Introduced over the past several months in a variety of super phones and tablets, the Tegra 2 super chip is finding a growing market, particularly among those interested in console-quality gaming on their mobile device. It is built with the world's first mobile dual-core CPU -- which unleashes the best Web experience, with up two-times faster browsing and support for full Adobe® Flash® Player hardware GPU acceleration, plus unprecedented multitasking capabilities. It also includes an NVIDIA GeForce® GPU -- which provides stunningly rich visual experiences and console-quality gaming.

Tegra Zone Highlights:

The first Tegra super chip-enhanced games include:

Samurai II: Vengeance, by MADFINGER Games: A hack-and-slash action game with stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay. On par with console 3D brawlers, Samurai II: Vengeance takes advantage of the raw processing power of Tegra 2 with four times more texture resolution on characters, increased geometry for more realism, and completely redesigned knockdown moves.

Dungeon Defenders: First Wave Deluxe HD, by Trendy Entertainment: Combines the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building, in a beautifully stylized cartoon fantasy setting. The Tegra-enhanced version includes dynamic lighting schemes and advanced post-processing effects, as well as the same number of maps and game play levels on PC and Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) versions. Due to the graphics capabilities of the Tegra 2 processor, players can join in multiplayer, cross-platform games across super phones, tablets, PCs and the PS3.

Galaxy on Fire 2 THD, by Fishlabs: Epic sci-fi adventure with spectacular action, compelling story and a free gameplay unparalleled in depth and complexity, available for the first time on Android. The Tegra super chip-enhanced version renders the action at a consistently smooth frame rate, and includes more detailed spaceships with much higher quality textures.

Backbreaker THD, by Natural Motion: An intense, arcade football experience that looks even better and is more interactive when enhanced on a Tegra 2 processor. This version features high-quality textures on the characters, field and stadium and more rendered content, such as real-time action replay on the ""Jumbotron"" scoreboard. Also look for realistic shadow effects and dynamic lighting effects such as lens flares.

Fruit Ninja THD, by Halfbrick Studios: A juicy action game with squishy, splatty and satisfying fruit carnage. The Tegra 2 super chip-enhanced version is the definitive version of the best-selling game and adds special graphic detail and effects, including smoother edges on the fruit models, more geometry and realistic shading and lighting.

Vendetta Online, by Guild Software: 3D space combat, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that permits thousands of players to interact as the pilots of spaceships in a vast universe, available for the first time on a mobile device. The Tegra super chip-enhanced version is the first cross-platform space MMO and allows gamers to play against PC players and other mobile players in the same universe.

Monster Madness, by SouthPeak Games: A top-down action/shooting game where players fight off the monster invasion in four-player melee action. This game takes advantage of NVIDIA PhysX® technology for realistic in-game physics effects. The Tegra processor-enhanced version is graphically identical to the console version in every way.

Hardwood Solitaire IV, by Silver Creek Entertainment: A beautiful rendition of 10 classic solitaire games. Ported from the PC and Xbox 360 versions, the Tegra 2 super chip version incorporates real-time lighting and shadows in their game environments and adds new 1080p high-resolution textures for the card faces and backs.

NVIDIA has worked closely with game developers to enhance games for the Tegra 2 super chip, bringing such features as:

More realism: Increased geometry detail, higher resolution textures and complex shaders, lighting, and shadows

More interactivity: Larger number of characters on screen and more instances of independent animations

Extra challenging: Advanced artificial intelligence processing , complex world and player management

Improved game play: More levels to tackle and more equipment for gaming characters to use

Better game play and an enhanced shopping experience

In 2008, the company's consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserve additions from all sources, before the effect of price-related revisions, of 463 million BOE, compared to production of 221 million BOE, for a production replacement ratio of 210 percent. At the end of 2008, Occidental's consolidated reserves-to-production ratio, assuming production remained at the 2008 level, was 13.5 years.

Excluding purchases of proved reserves and the effect of price revisions, the company added 253 million BOE of proved reserves on a consolidated basis, of which improved recovery provided 98 percent and extensions and discoveries provided 9 percent, partially offset by non-price-related negative revisions of 7 percent.

These additions were partially offset by negative revisions of 127 million BOE that were attributable to the difference between prices of oil and gas at year-end 2007 and year-end 2008. Negative domestic price revisions were partially offset by positive price revisions in the Middle East/North Africa, as a result of the impact of Production Sharing Contracts.

Occidental's costs for exploration and development activities were $4.4 billion. Additionally, Occidental incurred $3.5 billion in property acquisition costs. All of the acquisitions were domestic, mainly in the Rocky Mountains and the Permian Basin.

In 2008, proved developed reserves were 74 percent of total proved reserves. For the three-year period 2006 through 2008, Occidental's consolidated proved reserve additions totaled 1.1 billion BOE, and total production equaled 630 million BOE, for a reserve replacement ratio of 173 percent.

SANTA CLARA, CA -- The first textbook of its kind, ""Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach"" launches today, authored by Dr. David B. Kirk, NVIDIA Fellow and former chief scientist, and Dr. Wen-mei Hwu, who serves at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Coordinated Science Laboratory, co-director of the Universal Parallel Computing Research Center and principal investigator of the CUDA Center of Excellence.

The textbook, which is 256 pages, is the first aimed at teaching advanced students and professionals the basic concepts of parallel programming and GPU architectures. Published by Morgan-Kauffman, it explores various techniques for constructing parallel programs and reviews numerous case studies.

With conventional CPU-based computing no longer scaling in performance and the world's computational challenges increasing in complexity, the need for massively parallel processing has never been greater. GPUs have hundreds of cores capable of delivering transformative performance increases across a wide range of computational challenges. The rise of these multi-core architectures has raised the need to teach advanced programmers a new and essential skill: how to program massively parallel processors.

""I'd like to personally congratulate David and Wen-mei for writing this landmark book and enabling generations of student programmers to understand and exploit the massively parallel architecture of GPUs,"" said Bill Dally, chief scientist at NVIDIA and former chairman of Stanford University's computer science department. ""As a former professor, I have seen firsthand how seminal texts like this can transform a field. I look forward to seeing the transformation of computing as students are inspired and guided to master GPU computing by this book.""

Among the book's key features:

First and only text that teaches how to program within a massively parallel environment Portions of the NVIDIA-provided content have been part of the curriculum at 300 universities worldwide Drafts of sections of the book have been tested and taught by Kirk at the University of Illinois Book utilizes OpenCL(TM) and CUDA(TM) C, the NVIDIA(R) parallel computing language developed specifically for massively parallel environments

SANTA CLARA, CA -- NVIDIA today announced the Tesla Bio Workbench, which enables scientists to push the boundaries of biological research by turning a standard PC into a ""computational laboratory"" capable of running complex bioscience codes in fields such as drug discovery and DNA sequencing more than 10-20 times faster through the use of NVIDIA® Tesla™ GPUs.

The Tesla Bio Workbench consists of:

A range of GPU-optimized bioscience applications for molecular dynamics- and quantum chemistry- based research, including: AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD, TeraChem, VMD, and bioinformatics applications like CUDA-SW++ (Smith-Waterman), GPU-HMMER, and MUMmerGPU.

A community site for downloading the applications, checking out the latest benchmarks, reading academic papers and tutorials, joining discussion forums with the application developers themselves and more.

Details on the Tesla GPU-based workstations and clusters available worldwide for easy deployment of these applications.

Scientists have traditionally performed experiments in laboratories, where chemicals are combined, their interactions studied and their effectiveness measured. Advances in computational science have now enabled these experiments to be carried out using molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulation models, however these have typically required very large supercomputers with thousands of central processing units (CPUs).

By using the massively parallel CUDA™ architecture of NVIDIA GPUs, these applications can now be run 10-20 times faster, which means even a PC with Tesla GPUs can outperform a supercomputer.

Quotes:

""We are working on a new GPU-based technique in the VMD molecular dynamics visualization software that investigates how small molecules like oxygen and CO2 migrate inside proteins. This research is critical in the study of enzymatic reaction mechanisms,"" said John Stone, senior research programmer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""A simulation that takes 1 day to run on a GPU-based workstation would have taken 30 days to run on a CPU-based machine, rendering it impractical for real research.""

""TeraChem is a powerful molecular modeling package whose calculations can guide the design of new drugs while avoiding wasted time synthesizing unpromising candidates,"" said Todd Martinez, professor of physical and theoretical chemistry at Stanford University. ""With TeraChem, calculations that would have taken days or weeks on a computer cluster can now be performed routinely on NVIDIA GPU-enabled workstations. This allows high-throughput computational screening and can accelerate the drug design process.""

""Using AMBER to carry out simulations of a cellulose hydrolyzing enzyme called Cellobiohydrolaze-I, which is a key component in improving the efficiency of bio-ethanol production, we're seeing performance from a single NVIDIA GPU that's equivalent to a 10 node cluster,"" said Ross Walker, Research Professor at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, UC San Diego.

""Researchers here are using the GPU-based NAMD molecular dynamics software to study how virus cells react to different drugs, including studying the effectiveness of drugs on the H1N1 virus,"" said Klaus Schulten, Swanlund Professor of Physics, Director of the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics and Co-director of the NSF Center for the Physics of Living Cells at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""NAMD running on 4 GPUs in a workstation can outperform 16 CPUs in a server farm.""

""One of the future challenges of molecular simulation is to enable automated drug screening. We have traditionally used GROMACS to calculate the binding of drugs to membrane proteins by using large clusters, but this is both a costly and complex process,"" said Erik Lindahl, associate professor at the Center for Biomembrane Research at Stockholm University. ""We are now adding GPU support because a single GPU can be up to 4-5X faster than a CPU for most normal simulations. Within a few years, we expect workstations equipped with a handful of compute cards to have taken a huge part of the market and because of this we see NVIDIA as a critically important partner.""

SANTA CLARA, CA -- Improving the cleaning power of shampoos and liquid detergents and making them more environmentally friendly is as much a computer problem as it is a balance of chemicals. By harnessing the parallel processing power of NVIDIA(R) Tesla(TM) GPUs, researchers at Temple University are developing a computer simulation model which provides companies like Procter and Gamble with a fast, cost effective and accurate tool for research and development of surfactant molecules.

Surfactants have many uses; for example they provide the cleaning capacity and texture of shampoos, laundry detergents, and many other cleaning products. Their job is to attach themselves to dirt and make it mix with water, and their effectiveness in this process determines their ability to clean. The process of finding new, better surfactants and testing their effectiveness in laboratories is time consuming and costly.

""The computer models needed to accurately simulate surfactant properties are extremely demanding in terms of computational power,"" said Axel Kohlmeyer of the Institute for Computational Molecular Science at Temple University. ""We discovered that by adding just two NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPUs, each node in our newest cluster can do 16 times more work, and thus multiplies our local compute capacity far beyond what we could previously get through the national supercomputing centers.""

""To put this into context, we can run a single GPU-optimized molecular dynamics simulation on two Tesla GPUs as fast as we can on 128 CPU cores of a Cray XT3 supercomputer or on 1024 CPUs of an IBM BlueGene/L machine with conventional software,"" continues Dr. Kohlmeyer. ""With the NVIDIA Tesla GPU-based solution, we now have a more powerful, cost-effective solution that will enable us to advance critical research at a much faster pace. We're moving rapidly ahead to deploy a larger Tesla GPU cluster at Temple, which will give another huge boost to our work.""

The Temple researchers are using GPU-accelerated HOOMD (Highly Optimized Object Oriented Molecular Dynamics) simulation software, written by researchers at the Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory to leverage the NVIDIA GPUs.

In addition to deploying a small local GPU cluster, the university team will also look to scale its work using the NCSA Lincoln cluster, where the computational output has been boosted to 47 TeraFLOPS through the addition of Tesla S1070 1U GPU systems.

LAS VEGAS, NV -- 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW (South Hall 4 -- Booth #35912) -- NVIDIA and Audi announced today that NVIDIA® GPUs power the navigation and entertainment systems in all 2010 Audi vehicles worldwide.

This marriage of Silicon Valley technology and German engineering introduces cutting-edge GPUs to the automotive industry, enabling advanced visual capabilities such as full 3D navigation with advanced driver assistance and safety systems, and a ""dual zone"" entertainment system that enables two videos to be shown simultaneously on different screens.

The navigation and entertainment system in the new Audi 2010 product line is the 3G MMI, and it uses NVIDIA GPUs to process and generate all visual imagery. The built-in navigation system features 3D topography of buildings and cities, and real-time traffic reporting and navigation information given as audible route-guidance prompts and turn arrows via the color driver information system. This system can recognize complex scenarios and make anticipatory decisions to assist the driver, enhancing their ability to drive more safely.

In addition, NVIDIA worked with Audi to develop a complete multimedia engine called Vibrante that serves as the media backbone of 3G MMI. The Vibrante multimedia engine allows Audi passengers to watch DVDs; listen to music from an iPod, CD, SD card or USB memory stick; and enjoy online video content.

As another automotive-industry first, the Vibrante engine supports ""dual zone"" entertainment with a single GPU, enabling passengers to simultaneously enjoy two different movies on two different screens on the backseat monitors.

""Visual computing has become key differentiator among luxury cars, whether it's delivering the necessary information to the driver or offering state-of-the-art entertainment options to the passengers,"" said Johan de Nysschen, president, Audi of America. ""We partnered with NVIDIA because it is clearly the leader in this field.""

NVIDIA and Audi also worked with Google to enable Google Earth on future 3G MMI systems powered by NVIDIA GPUs, beginning in the flagship Audi A8 in 2011. Google Earth is based on a technology developed by Keyhole, a company NVIDIA invested in and Google later acquired. The result of this three-way partnership is an industry first -- a stunning 3D navigation system with detailed terrain models, snappy performance, 3D landmarks and a highly intuitive visual interface.

The Google-based service enables drivers to plan trips at home and then retrieve the trip routes from their car as needed. Users can also search for points-of-interest directly from the 3G MMI. This will be the first time that Google Earth will be available in any production vehicle.

In addition, the next generation NVIDIA® Tegra™ ultra low-power HD mobile processors will drive the advanced entertainment and navigation systems in all 2012 Audi vehicles, as well as other Volkswagen AG brands, including Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamborghini, SEAT and SKODA, in varying levels of functionality. Next-generation NVIDIA Tegra processors are architected to deliver rich 3D visuals, unmatched multimedia and a complete web experience on a variety of devices. Tegra's eight individual processors will help Audi consolidate two completely different electronics systems with separate boxes into one tiny chip. Tegra will also increase system performance and lower power consumption by 10x in Audi's entertainment and navigation systems, for increased fuel efficiency.

""The primary focus of car computing is safety,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. ""With the power of Tegra's eight processors, the car's computing system can have cameras both inside and outside the vehicle monitoring the driver and the road, providing real-time feedback and guiding you to your next destination, all at the same time.""

In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Occidental achieved year-over-year production growth of nearly seven percent in the third quarter and eight percent in the nine months of 2009. In addition, higher worldwide crude oil prices resulted in an increase in Occidental's third quarter of 2009 net income of 36 percent over the second quarter of 2009.

""Our Kern County discovery has made a significant contribution to this production growth. Kern County gross production run rates grew from 7,700 BOE per day around the end of the first quarter, to 17,300 BOE per day at the end of the second quarter and to approximately 26,000 BOE per day at the end of the third quarter.""

QUARTERLY RESULTS

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $3.6 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the third quarter 2009 segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating expenses.

For the third quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 628,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 588,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2008. Volumes increased by six percent domestically, mainly from California and the Permian and by 15 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely in Dolphin and Oman, partially offset by a six-percent decrease in Latin America mostly due to a labor strike in Argentina. Increased California volumes resulted largely from the new exploration discoveries in Kern County.

Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $62.79 per barrel for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $104.15 per barrel for the third quarter of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.35 per MCF in the third quarter of 2008 to $3.04 per MCF for the third quarter of 2009.

Chemicals

Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $72 million, compared with $219 million for the same period in 2008. The third quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower margins for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride and lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and polyvinyl chloride.

Midstream, Marketing and Other

Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $66 million for the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter of 2009 reflects better results in marketing operations, partially offset by lower margins in the gas processing business.

NINE MONTH RESULTS

Net income for the nine months of 2009 was $2.0 billion ($2.43 per diluted share), compared with $6.4 billion ($7.77 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2008.

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas segment earnings were $3.1 billion for the nine months of 2009, compared with $10.3 billion for the same period of 2008. The decrease in segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating and administrative costs.

Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the first nine months was 643,000 BOE per day for 2009, compared with 594,000 BOE per day for the same 2008 period. Volumes increased by five percent domestically mainly in California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by 14 percent in Latin America, and by 12 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely due to Dolphin and Oman.

Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $51.44 per barrel for the nine months of 2009, compared with $100.39 per barrel for the nine months of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.18 per MCF in the nine months of 2008 to $3.15 per MCF in the nine months of 2009.

Chemicals

Chemical segment earnings were $356 million for the nine months of 2009, compared with $542 million for the nine months of 2008. The 2009 results reflect lower volumes and prices for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride due to the economic slowdown, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.

Midstream, Marketing and Other

Midstream segment earnings were $154 million for the nine months of 2009, compared with $350 million for the same period in 2008. The earnings decline in 2009 reflects lower margins in the gas processing business.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS

Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called ""core results,"" which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Primarily a trader in oil and gas, Phibro's assets consist of cash, marketable securities and readily saleable commodity positions. Phibro does not trade in any exotic derivatives or hold any level three type assets. Occidental's net investment in Phibro is expected to be about $250 million.

Phibro's management team, headed by Andrew Hall, and its employees will remain with the company after closing. The senior management team has agreed to make a significant investment in Phibro and receive returns dependent upon the company's future performance. Additionally, significant portions of current and future bonuses will be deferred and retained by Phibro and paid out in future years. These future payouts will be adjusted to reflect Phibro's results during that period.

From 1997 until the second quarter of 2009, Phibro averaged approximately $200 million per year in pre-tax earnings, while over the last five years Phibro's earnings averaged $371 million per year. Phibro has been profitable each fiscal year since 1997, attaining profitability in 80 percent of all quarters.

The transaction is expected to close by year end. Upon closing, Occidental will support the credit of Phibro. Phibro will become a part of Occidental's midstream segment which includes Occidental's natural gas liquids, power, pipeline and existing trading business.

In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Occidental achieved year-over-year production growth of 10 percent in the second quarter and nearly nine percent in the six months of 2009. Our discovery in Kern County, California which was announced yesterday should also contribute to our future growth.""

QUARTERLY RESULTS Oil and Gas

Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $3.8 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the second quarter 2009 segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating expenses.

For the second quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 649,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 588,000 BOE sold in the second quarter of 2008. Volumes increased by approximately 3 percent domestically, mainly from California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by about 37 percent in Latin America mostly in Argentina, and by 16 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely in Oman and Dolphin. California volumes included increases in Long Beach resulting from economic arrangements similar to a production sharing contract and production from new exploration wells in Elk Hills.

Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $52.97 per barrel for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $110.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.99 per MCF in the second quarter of 2008 to $2.87 per MCF for the second quarter of 2009.

Chemicals

Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter 2009 were $115 million, compared with $144 million for the same period in 2008. The second quarter of 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride. The lower volumes were partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.

Midstream, Marketing and Other

Midstream segment earnings were $63 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $161 million for the second quarter of 2008. The second quarter of 2009 earnings reflect lower margins in the gas processing, marketing, and power generation businesses.

SIX MONTH RESULTS

Net income for the six months of 2009 was $1.1 billion ($1.29 per diluted share), compared with $4.1 billion ($5.00 per diluted share) for the six months of 2008.

Core results were $1.1 billion ($1.34 per diluted share) for the six months of 2009, compared with $4.1 billion ($4.97 per diluted share) for the six months of 2008.

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.6 billion for the six months of 2009, compared with $6.7 billion for the same period of 2008. The decrease in segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by increased sales volumes and lower operating and administrative costs.

Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the first six months was 651,000 BOE for 2009, compared with 598,000 BOE per day for the same 2008 period. Volumes increased by approximately 4 percent domestically mainly from California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by about 26 percent in Latin America mostly in Argentina, and by 11 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely due to Oman and Dolphin. Higher volumes in domestic assets included production from new exploration wells in California.

Oxy's worldwide crude oil realized price was $46.05 per barrel for the six months of 2009, compared with $98.16 per barrel for the six months of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.09 per MCF in the six months of 2008 to $3.20 per MCF in the six months of 2009.

Chemicals

Chemical segment earnings for the six months of 2009 were $284 million, compared with $323 million for the same period of 2008. The 2009 six month results reflect lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride due to the economic slowdown, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.

Midstream, Marketing and Other

Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the six months of 2009, compared with $284 million for the same period in 2008. The earnings decline in 2009 reflects lower margins in the gas processing, power generation, and marketing businesses.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called ""core results,"" which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Occidental believes there are between 150 million and 250 million gross barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) reserves within the outlined area where Oxy has drilled six wells to date to delineate the discovery. The multi-pay zone discovery area, whose areal geological extent is still being defined, has both conventional and unconventional pay zones. The bulk of the discovery's producing zones are conventional oil and gas bearing formations.

Occidental's interest in the discovery area is approximately 80 percent. Approximately two-thirds of the discovery is believed to be natural gas.

""We believe this to be the largest new oil and gas discovery made in California in more than 35 years,"" said Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.

""It is probable that there are additional reserves outside the defined area, and it is possible that structures of this type exist elsewhere in Oxy's 1.1 million net acre position in California. We plan to drill wells to exploit these opportunities over the next 5 to 10 years,"" Dr. Irani said.

Oxy is currently the largest natural gas producer and third-largest oil producer in the state of California, where the company has produced oil and gas for more than 50 years. Oxy's assets in the state include more than 7,500 active wells located in 90 fields, spanning 600 miles. Oxy's California proved reserves were 708 million BOE at year-end 2008 and represent approximately 24 percent of Oxy's worldwide reserves.

Stockholders also received updates on significant 2008 activities in Oxy's core oil and gas producing regions.
It is expected to help boost Oxy's production in the area by a minimum of 50,000 barrels per day within the next five years.","LOS ANGELES, May 1, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ray R. Irani reported on the company's record 2008 financial and operational achievements at Oxy's annual stockholders' meeting today in Santa Monica, California.

""Notably in 2008, we achieved record earnings of $6.9 billion -- the highest in our 88-year history and a 27-percent increase over the 2007 result,"" Dr. Irani announced. Oxy's net income has increased 166 percent over the past five years.

Among additional 2008 financial highlights, the company achieved return on equity (ROE) of 27 percent, and a year-end debt-to-capitalization ratio of 9 percent -- among the lowest of the major oil and gas companies, and significantly lower than the average for all U.S. industrial companies. Oxy finished 2008 with cash of $1.8 billion and very little net debt while stockholders' equity increased 20 percent. Since year-end 2004, Oxy has reduced its debt by 29 percent while stockholders' equity has grown by 158 percent.

""These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our ongoing business strategy with its continual focus on building stockholder value. With our commitment to strict financial management -- limiting risk and leverage -- Oxy has proven to be well positioned for success, even in these challenging economic times,"" said Dr. Irani.

On April 30, Oxy's Board of Directors declared an increase in the company's annual dividend to stockholders of $.04, to an annual rate of $1.32 per share of common stock, Dr. Irani announced. Oxy has raised the dividend every year since 2002. This increase is the company's eighth over the period, during which Oxy's dividend has risen 164 percent. The company has paid quarterly dividends continuously since 1975.

Oxy continues to lead its proxy peer group in total stockholder return, based on stock price appreciation plus dividend reinvestment. Since 2006, Oxy has delivered stockholder return of approximately 60 percent, outperforming the S&P 500 Index as well as its industry peer group.

Worldwide oil and natural gas production increased by 5.4 percent in 2008, averaging 601,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. The company continues to earn more income per barrel than its competitors. In 2008, for the 10th consecutive year, Oxy led its industry peers in operating income per BOE, with more than $31 per barrel.

In 2008, Oxy replaced 152 percent of its production, including the effect of price changes from the previous year. Oxy's proved reserve additions over the past three years total 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, for an average replacement rate of 173 percent. By consistently replacing more than 100 percent of its production, Oxy is an industry leader in reserve replacement.

Stockholders also received updates on significant 2008 activities in Oxy's core oil and gas producing regions. ""Today we have a focused strategy with 60 percent of our production coming from the United States, 27 percent coming from the Middle East and 13 percent coming from Latin America. This approach has been profitable and rewarding,"" said Dr. Irani.

Among the 2008 developments in the United States, Oxy completed two purchases totaling $2.7 billion for interests in the Permian Basin of southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and the Piceance Basin of Colorado. The acquisitions provided 26,500 BOE per day net to Oxy at the time of purchase.

In addition, Oxy entered into an agreement to develop a hydrocarbon gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure in West Texas. The project, which broke ground in March 2009, will provide an environmentally advantageous process for the use of carbon dioxide to increase U.S. oil and natural gas production. It is expected to help boost Oxy's production in the area by a minimum of 50,000 barrels per day within the next five years.

Oxy also engaged in several transactions in 2008 with its partners in the Middle East/North Africa, a key growth region for the company. These included a preliminary agreement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to develop two fields in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi; an Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement with Mubadala Development Company to develop four existing gas fields and explore for new discoveries in the Sultanate of Oman; and initial work with Bahrain Petroleum Company to further explore three blocks offshore Bahrain.

Most recently, Oxy was selected as the winning bidder to work with the National Oil and Gas Authority of Bahrain to further develop the onshore Bahrain Field. Oxy signed a definitive agreement with the Kingdom of Bahrain on April 26 and final approval by the Bahraini Parliament is expected in the near future.

Dr. Irani also reported to stockholders that OxyChem, the company's highly efficient chemical segment, achieved 11-percent earnings growth in 2008 -- with total earnings of $669 million. Chemical-reported earnings accounted for about 6 percent of Oxy's total segment earnings last year.

At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders reelected the Board of Directors for a term expiring in 2010, ratified the selection of KPMG LLP as the independent auditors for 2009 and approved the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to permit the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding common stock to call a special meeting. A stockholder proposal with respect to a report on host country laws did not pass.

Looking ahead, Dr. Irani said: ""We believe Oxy is well positioned to succeed in today's volatile business environment. As we look to the future, we will build on Oxy's strengths in order to continue to deliver performance, growth and value.""

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas segment earnings were $545 million for the first quarter of 2009. After excluding rig termination costs of $8 million, the first quarter 2009 core results were $553 million, compared with $2.9 billion for the same period in 2008. The $2.3 billion decrease in the first quarter 2009 results reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates.

For the first quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 654,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 607,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2008. Volume increases were 22,000 BOE per day in domestic operations, largely in the Rockies and California, 15,000 BOE per day in Oman, and 10,000 BOE per day in Argentina.

Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $39.29 per barrel for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $86.75 per barrel for the first quarter of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $8.15 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the first quarter of 2008 to $3.54 per MCF for the first quarter of 2009.

Oil and gas cash production costs, including taxes - other than on income, declined from $14.75 per BOE for the total year 2008 to $12.19 per BOE for the first quarter of 2009.

Chemicals

Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $169 million, compared with $179 million for the same period in 2008. The first quarter of 2009 results reflect higher caustic soda margins, offset by lower volumes in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride.

Midstream, Marketing and Other

Midstream segment earnings were $14 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2008. The earnings decline for the first quarter of 2009 reflects significantly lower NGL prices in the gas processing business and negative mark to market adjustments in crude oil marketing.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS

Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called ""core results,"" which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
